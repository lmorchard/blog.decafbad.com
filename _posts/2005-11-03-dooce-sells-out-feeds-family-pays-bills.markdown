<blockquote cite="http://www.dooce.com/archives/daily/11_01_2005.html">First, I want to say that no one should apologize for their gut reaction to the redesign. All of this feedback is valid. You, my readers, have seen me and supported me through some of the roughest times in my life and the last thing I want to do is alienate you. I understand why some of you are upset about the ads.</blockquote>

For what it's worth, I think her new ad-laden design was done in the least obnoxious way possible.  Rather than dumping the ads "above the fold"—right in the middle of the interesting part (ie. the blog post)—hers are like billboards on the side of the road.  

Where many bloggers would tile an arabesque, she's got moneymakers.  Either way, my <strike>peril-sensitive</strike> advertising-sensitive sunglasses block them out just the same, but with less scrolling.
