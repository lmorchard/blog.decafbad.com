So.  It's been awhile since I spent much time here actually writing.  The [quick links][links] have been fun, but they're just not the same as really posting something of my own.  There've been numerous reasons for my semi-disappearance, but I think I'd finally like to come back now.  Maybe I'll even spend a few entries writing about what's happened over the past year or so.  It's been a bit of a trip.

But first, I've got to get this new site launched.  By the time you read this, there will have been some changes.  It will have been a little over a year since the last time I did [something drastic][drastic] around here.  In fact, I'd intended this to happen right around [this site's birthday][birthday], but I think I needed to read [Joel on Software on Perfectionism][perfectionism], and [mamamusing's Talking Heads reference][talkingheads], to get me to finally bite the bullet and push the button.

There's bound to be bugs and problems galore here, but I've got to get past the tinkering and strip away my excuses for not actually writing here.  I actually started putting this new site together back in early December, and have been putzing around since.  Now that it's just about there, I realize I'm actually afraid to start writing again.  (As if I were any sort of writer worth reading before.  Bah.  Get over it.)

Here it is, then.  I'm back to using Movable Type, probably just in time to fuss about upgrading to 3.0.  Nothing wrong with [blosxom][blosxom], or [pyblosxom][pyblosxom] for that matter, but a confluence of available plugins, exasperation, and fiddling brought me back.  I think the result's turned out rather nifty, so one of my first runs of entries will be a sort of colophon.  Maybe someone else will find something worthwhile in that.  

This time, I've gone from having a wiki and a blog to having a wiki, a blog, and a linkblog.  (There've got to be better words for these things.)  The links were mashed up with the rare blog entry, and I got more than one comment wishing they were separate.  Makes sense to me.  So...  three separate parts to this site, each separate for a reason, but all intermingled too.

Anyway, before I ramble on too much longer about an idea which might just be NeatLikeDigitalWatches instead of *actually* neat, I should get this thing launched and start using it...
