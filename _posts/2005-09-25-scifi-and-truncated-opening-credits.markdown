Using the net to catch up on episodes of scifi shows I happened to miss the night before has some interesting results:  For instance, I really dislike the new "truncated" opening credits that the SciFi Channel here in the US has been using for all its Friday night shows.  But, I just started watching a Stargate Atlantis episode from Canada which presents a full-length credit sequence.  I like it much better.
