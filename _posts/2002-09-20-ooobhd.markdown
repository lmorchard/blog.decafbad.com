Today's bundle of little discoveries:
<br /><br />
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.pth.com/DSBRTuner/">DSBRTuner</a> has been updated to support <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AppleScript">AppleScript</a> since last I downloaded it.
</li>
<li> <a href="http://www.pth.com/DSBRTuner/">DSBRTuner</a> has been updated to record to MP3 on disk.
</li>
<li> <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MacOSX">MacOSX</a> has a command called <code>osascript</code> with which you can launch <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AppleScript">AppleScripts</a> (among other things) from a shell.
</li>
<li> Like <code>perl</code>, <code>osascript</code> has an option <code>-e</code> to run a one-liner from the shell.
</li>
</ul>
<br /><br />
Given these discoveries, I was able to cobble together a quick pair of scripts with which to schedule recording radio broadcasts to MP3 via cron.
<br /><br />
Wow.  Another little project that became, all of a sudden, so much easier than I thought.  I love Unix and OS X.  Before this, I'd been looking high and low for all the parts:  a scheduler, a sound recorder, an app controller, etc &amp; so forth.  Given the source code to DSBRTuner, I was almost about to hack some solutions into it, but I'd never gotten the time.
<br /><br />
Now, I can happily record and listen to my favorite late Sunday night radio show during the week again!
<br /><br />
Oh yeah, and the ugly scripts:
<br /><br />
1) dsbr_start_recording
<pre>#!/bin/sh
FREQ=$1
MP3_FN="$2-`date "+%Y%m%dT%H%M%S"`.mp3"
OSA=/usr/bin/osascript
TELL='tell application "DSBRTUNER" to'

open /Applications/DSBRTuner.app
$OSA -e "$TELL set frequency to $FREQ"
$OSA -e "$TELL record to file "$MP3_FN""</pre>
<br /><br />
2) dsbr_stop_recording
<pre>#!/bin/sh
OSA=/usr/bin/osascript
TELL='tell application "DSBRTUNER" to'

open /Applications/DSBRTuner.app
$OSA -e "$TELL stop recording"
$OSA -e "$TELL quit"</pre>
