I'm getting a bit tired of my [TWiki][twiki] install--  I never really liked the WikiText variant it uses, and it seems a bit heavy and slightly overkill.  Admittedly, I haven't bothered to follow the project or upgrade my installation in over a year or so, but it just hasn't appealed to me.

So, I'm going to try out [Kwiki][kwiki].  I like the WikiText, the module system, and the templating system better.  Also, it seems quite a bit less lumbering to me, which is wholly subjective at this point.  I haven't put much effort at all into making it fit within my site template, but that should be easy enough once I get the time.

To start off, I'm going to work on emptying out my head on [dbagg3 / FeedReactor][feedreactor].
