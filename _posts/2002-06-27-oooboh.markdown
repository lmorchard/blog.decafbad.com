<p>Cool, looks like <a href="http://www.movabletype.org/trackback/">TrackBack</a> is working and starting to catch on this morning.  I caught a <a href="http://philringnalda.com/archives/002248.php">nice compliment</a> about my mutant <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000187.phtml#000187">outline skin for <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk">AmphetaDesk</a></a>.  Must get back around to the next iteration of that thing, add some polish and some new features.</p>
<p>As for the MT upgrade from last night... looks like it nuked my post categories.  Grr.  That kind of blows chunks.  Might have to see what that's all about, since I sagely backed everything up first.  Another thing is that I'd like to look more into this <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack">TrackBack</a> feature and the concept of <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack">TrackBack</a> URLs and pings.  Namely:  It's a pain in the ass to cut &amp; paste the TB URL, and the bookmarklet hasn't worked for me yet.  </p>
<p>I notice that there's some <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF">RDF</a> embedded in my posts now, describing the <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack">TrackBack</a> link.  Unfortunately, I don't see where the <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF">RDF</a> explains that it is, in fact, about a <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack">TrackBack</a> link.  Though I haven't dug into the workings yet, I assume that this is how <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack">TrackBack</a>-enabled pages discover info about pages from which they've been pinged.  </p>
<p>What would be nice is if the <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF">RDF</a> also identifies itself as <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack">TrackBack</a> info.  This way, I could hack <i>my</i> Movable Type to pluck URLs out of a post I'm publishing, go take a visit to each URL and try to harvest the <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF">RDF</a>, and then automatically discover the ping URL and ping it.  All I'd need to do to activate the process is include a link to a page elsewhere that contains <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF">RDF</a> hints on how/where to ping.</p>
<p>Always looking to get more for less effort.  :)</p>
