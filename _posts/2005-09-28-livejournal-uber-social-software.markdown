I've just noticed that [LiveJournal added a School Directory](http://www.livejournal.com/schools/), where you can search for schools you've attended and add them and the years you were there to your user info.  Here's where I was between the years of 1989 and 1997:

* [Algonac High School - Algonac, MI (1989-1993)](http://www.livejournal.com/schools/?ctc=US&sc=MI&cc=Algonac&sid=1252)
* [Central Michigan University - Mount Pleasant, MI (1993-1997)](http://www.livejournal.com/schools/?ctc=US&sc=MI&cc=Mount+Pleasant&sid=8406)

Goodbye, [Classmates.com](http://www.classmates.com)?  I've told people for years that *every* other social software app on the web is a reinvention of LiveJournal, done badly.  

I'll never do it, but ever since I realized that LJ was Open Source, I've wanted to launch my own LJ-based social software site.  The only difference would be that your [User Info](http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=deus_x) is what would appear as the main page under your personal URL, and the Journal would just be a secondary tab in the sidebar.

Because, after all, wouldn't that pretty much match 90-99% of the features offered by things like Friendster, Orkut, Tribe, and friends?  (Oh, and if you use this idea, and make lots of moneyâ€”hire me or something, will ya?)
