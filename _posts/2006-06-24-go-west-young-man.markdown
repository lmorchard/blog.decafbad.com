 <p>In the first half of this year, I've been really busy.  My fits of posts and stretches of silence around here can attest to that.  In fact, I've been so busy that I managed to finish a book, get married, and go on a honeymoon - all whilst being fully engaged in a dayjob.</p>
 <p>My new wife had it easy this year - instead of her usual full load of university classes and all the jobs she does for both of us, all she had to do was plan a wedding and arrange a honeymoon!  (And in case you've never planned a wedding, you should know that I'm being sarcastic here.  My lovely bride has been busier than you could imagine.  I helped, but not nearly enough.)</p>
 <p>The one thing that we haven't done this year - which I've somehow managed to do almost every year for the past decade - is packup and move.  We even moved last year while I was in the middle of writing my first book, albeit only about a quarter-mile down the road.</p><p>The obvious conclusion, then, is that neither my wife nor I have been busy enough this year.  It's time to move again.</p>
 <p>But, there'll be no cakewalk quarter-mile jaunts for us this time.  No, this year - in fact, in the next month - we'll somehow be moving almost 2500 miles away.  Yes, that's right:  We're moving from the Detroit, MI area to the Bay Area in California, and I'm not quite sure how it's all going to work out.  But, I do know that we need to be there before July 17th.</p>
 <p>And, why is the 17th of July a significant date, you ask?  Well, that's when I start work at Yahoo! in Santa Clara, of course.</p>
 <p>I've tried to be a bit cagey about my job and employers over the past few years, just to avoid difficulties and unnecessary disclosures - but this change in career is a big one that I just can't keep under wraps.  Of course, I'm not planning to blog every little detail and become another "fired for blogging" statistic on the superhighway, but I'm admitting this much.  And, damn, am I excited.</p>
