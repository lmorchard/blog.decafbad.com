I'm feeling a bit retro in terms of gadgets right now.  And I don't know if it's a matter of reduced expectations or what, but I'm finding myself strangely happier with this situation.  

The screen on my [Treo 600][treo] suffered a crack, and although it was still limping along as a phone, it just wasn't worth it.  And besides, the thing has disappointed me overall--crappy phone, crappy camera, crappy screen, outmoded OS, badly thought-out headset/headphone situation.  

After having looked forward to getting one so much, I'm happy to be done with it now.  I just hope I can find my receipts to call in the replacement policy and maybe eBay an unopened [Treo][treo] to recoup some costs.  Oh, and not be tempted to buy a new camera just to use the spare 512MB SD card I have sitting around now.

So, the [Treo][] has been replaced by my old [Samsung A500][a500] phone and a first-gen [Handspring Visor Deluxe][visor], both of which I dug out of old junk boxes in the basement.  

The [Samsung A500][a500] phone works well, makes calls, fits comfortably in the same pocket as my wallet.  And, over the years, it's taken a great share of knocks and drops and has barely flinched.  I've downgraded my phone service a bit and abandoned most of the data features, which will save me some money for awhile.  I kind of wish I had a camera on this phone, but I won't cry over the savings from the missing data plan, nor will I pine for carrying [the external camera attachment][cam] Sprint offered for the phone.

The [Handspring Visor][visor] has also taken a number of knocks, but keeps going.  The only glitchy bit is that I have to jam a few post-it notes in the cradle with it to ensure a connection, because some of the copper has rubbed off the contacts on the bottom of the PDA.  (I think I might invest in a conductive ink pen.)  Oh, and it doesn't have a rechargeable battery pack--I'll have to seek out some decent solution with rechargeable AAA's (do they even make those anymore?)  But, I remember Graffiti and can probably write that as fast or faster than I could thumb-type on the [Treo][].

The really odd thing is that, although the OS on the [Visor][] is even further behind than what I had on the [Treo][], I'm not too sad with it.  Like I said, maybe it's because I'm just not expecting that much.  Hell, I was happy to remember that this model has a backlight!  I miss the internet connectivity a bit, but I never used it much on the [Treo][] because the lack of multitasking and quasi-dialup experience always just pissed me off.  

But, the address book and date book work on the [Visor][], though I only wish I hadn't lost my regcode for [DateBk5][dtb].  It syncs with my PowerBook.  I can get text files back and forth with [NoteTaker][mnt], which ties into all *sorts* of things.  And, best of all, [Frobnitz][frob] and [Rogue][rogue] both work.
  
I'm slowly rediscovering a few of the tools I used to use on this thing, and telling myself that it's just slightly better than a stack of 3x5 cards.  Because you know, although I love my Moleskine, I just never could quite get into the [Hipster PDA][pda] thing.  This is unplugged enough for me, thanks.  

Anyway...  anyone have any cool tricks or tips for my [Samsung A500][a500] phone or this [Handspring Visor][visor]?
