* Because it bears repeating, here's [something I just wrote in a comment][com]:

  > I think the problem now is that, after having used a Palm III with a Novatel Minstrel wireless cradle like 7 years ago, I expect flying cars by now :)

  I also later got a [Minstrel III][m3], but I can't even find a picture or a link to the nasty brick that was the original Minstrel for Palm.  Also, I hacked together [a gnarly cable][cable] to use the Minstrel with my Sony Vaio 505TR laptop running Mandrake Linux so I could work/play in coffee shops in the pre-wifi days.

  Back then, I really wanted to get deeper into wireless and mobile tech--but I never got the big bucks to buy many toys to do it on my own, nor managed to meet anyone in the know.  And these were pre-blog days for me, so of course I hadn't yet caught on to blabbing thoughts like these out into the ether.

  I still want to do more with mobile tech, though.  So, [Russell][], let me know if you ever need to hire a researcher!  :)  (Or if anyone else needs a researcher, for that matter.)

* Month-old tabs in Firefox now.  Remember when I was [bragging about that in OmniWeb][brag]?  [Greasemonkey][gm] is what finally dragged me back--and [SessionSaver][ss] and [Flashblock][fb] have kept me put, for now. 

  Now, if only I could get <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Move_the_tabbar_(Firefox)">a vertically-oriented tab bar *with* scrollbar</a> working in Firefox.
