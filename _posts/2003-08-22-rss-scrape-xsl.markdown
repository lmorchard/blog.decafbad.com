This is basically what I do now with a half-baked Java app using JTidy, XPath, and BeanShell.  I keep meaning to release it, but it&#8217;s too embarassing to share so far.  Yet, it&#8217;s been working well enough to scrape what sites I&#8217;m interested in such that I haven&#8217;t been too motivated to tidy it up and tarball it.  One thing I like better about Bill Humphries&#8217; approach, though, is that it doesn&#8217;t use Java :)</p>
