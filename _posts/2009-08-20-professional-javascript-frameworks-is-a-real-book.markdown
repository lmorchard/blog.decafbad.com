Introducing [Professional JavaScript Frameworks][profjs], my first multi-author book project and the result of almost 2 years' writing, editing, revising, and cat herding.  The author roster changed a few times in the process, as did the editorial oversight, but finally the thing's hitting shelves.

This one's been a <strong><em>long</em></strong> time coming, but it's finally sitting in my grubby little hands:

My contribution to this book includes all of the material from [The Concise Guide to Dojo][dojobook], plus a second concise guide worth of material on the [MooTools JS framework][mootools].  In addition to my work, you can find the work of [Ara Pehlivanian][ara] on [YUI][yui], [Scott Koon][koon] on [Prototype][prototype], and Harley Jones on [ExtJS][extjs].
