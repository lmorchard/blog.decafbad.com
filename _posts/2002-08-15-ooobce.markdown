<p><a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/08/15.html#better_living_through_regular_expressions">Better living through regular expressions</a> from Mark Pilgrim.  This has got me thinking of two things:<ol><li>I need to hack together some MT macros or a plugin that finds &amp; links wiki-words in blog entries to my wiki, and I need to start writing in the wiki again.</li><li>I really dig his blog's skin, and I need to finally read though all of his <a href="http://diveintoaccessibility.org/">accessibility tips</a> and re-skin this site.  This place is butt-ugly.</li></ol></p>
