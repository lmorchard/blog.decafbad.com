Hacking RSS and Atom has gotten [an absolutely glowing and enthusiastic recommendation from Todd Cochrane of Geek News Central](http://www.geeknewscentral.com/archives/004907.html)!  I was flipping through a few pent-up podcasts I had laying around before purging the backlog, and found this mention at the tail-end of GNC #101.

Not only did he call my book "totally, totally amazing," but he also called me a gentleman.  Thank you very much, Todd!  And with this sort of glowing review, I'd feel remiss without mentioning that [Todd's book <i>Podcasting</i>](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0764597787/0xdecafbad01-20) is mighty fine as well.

**Update:** Holy crap--looks like Todd liked my book well enough to toss a panel into his sidebar to buy it from Amazon!
