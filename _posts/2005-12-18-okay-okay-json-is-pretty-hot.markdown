The XML <strike>purist</strike> fanboy in me has had me *pshaw*'ing at JSON.  But, now that [the recent JSON release from Yahoo!][yj] reminded me of its existence and I [gave it a shot][gs] myself, I have to admit that it's pretty hotâ€”if only for the cross-domain bridging capabilities and the no-fuss parsing.

Although, I do worry about running into a poisoned payload someday that raids my cookie jar.
