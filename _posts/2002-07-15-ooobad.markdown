<p>Ack!  So I was trying to switch my <a href="http://www.pairnic.com">PairNIC</a>-hosted domain over to <a href="http://www.dyndns.org">DynDNS</a>'s Custom DNS service last week.  I thought all was well, since I followed the directions exactly.  As it was, it really only consisted of "Set your domain's nameservers to ns[1-5].mydyndns.org".  So I did that, then left for a few days.  Come back and I see that it failed miserably, and took 36 hours or so to switch back to <a href="http://www.zoneedit.com">ZoneEdit</a>.  Grr.  The only thing I noticed was that <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/PairNIC?topicparent=Main.FilterData"><b>?</b></a><font color="#0000FF">PairNIC</font></span>'s control panel appeared to randomize the order of the nameserver addresses I entered, and <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/DynDNS?topicparent=Main.FilterData"><b>?</b></a><font color="#0000FF">DynDNS</font></span> had a note in the docs stating that I needed to have only <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/DynDNS?topicparent=Main.FilterData"><b>?</b></a><font color="#0000FF">DynDNS</font></span> nameservers listed in my record and no mixing with other DNS hosts.  Could it be that <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/DynDNS?topicparent=Main.FilterData"><b>?</b></a><font color="#0000FF">DynDNS</font></span> is picky about the order in which my record lists nameservers?</p>
<p>Grr.  Well, I'm back on the air.  I just hope not too many of you out there with news aggregators and auto-unsub-on-error have had me slide off your lists.</p>
