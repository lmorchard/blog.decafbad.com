Just in case it's already been done, or I don't get around do doing it, hear me oh [LazyWeb][lw]:  

I want to cobble together a version of [IPython][ip] (or at least an [InteractiveConsole][ic]) that runs on a network socket for access via telnet.  I then intend to upload this to my [XBMC-equipped Xbox][xb] and run it as a command shell there for access from my LAN.  It seems like an idea that should work, since XBMC packs a Python install.
