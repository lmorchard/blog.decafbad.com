I've got one last XOXO post in me, and then I'll probably be done jabbering about this for awhile.  Did you know that just about all of my blog posts have several outlines embedded?  It's true.  

Since I only spent about 20 minutes on this so far, the process is still a bit rough and not quite generalized.  But, just for a demo:

* Take this blog post: [Outlining by the fittest](http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/11/26/outlining-by-the-fittest)
* Run it through this XSL: [xoxo-to-opml.xsl](http://decafbad.com/2005/11/xoxo-to-opml.xsl)
* Be my guest and use my web service: [Here be the OPML!](http://decafbad.com/2005/11/tidyxslt?xsl=http://decafbad.com/2005/11/xoxo-to-opml.xsl&doc=http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/11/26/outlining-by-the-fittest)
* Furthermore, be Julian Bond's guest and use his OPML browser: [Here be the <strike>OPML</strike> HTML!](http://www.voidstar.com/opml/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdecafbad.com%2F2005%2F11%2Ftidyxslt%3Fxsl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fdecafbad.com%252F2005%252F11%252Fxoxo-to-opml.xsl%26doc%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Fdecafbad.com%252Fblog%252F2005%252F11%252F26%252Foutlining-by-the-fittest)

Hooray for [The power of the URL-line](http://207.22.26.166/bytecols/2001-08-15.html)! Now, when I finally get off my butt and compose a new blogroll, you'll be able to get an OPML version in a similar way.  See, this stuff feels a bit like magic to me.
