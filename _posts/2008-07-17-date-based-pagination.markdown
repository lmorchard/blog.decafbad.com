Here's a small idea I've not yet had the chance to try out on a large scale:  Time-based pagination in lieu of page-number-based pagination for personal content - ie. blogs, bookmarks, status updates, etc.  (You know, User Generated Content except I dislike the term.)

Page numbers change over time, while time-based URLs are stable.  Most people don't generate an unreasonable amount of stuff in a day, so a page-per-day might not be so bad.  But, if there's too much stuff, degenerate to a page-per-12-hours or whatnot.

Delicious used to have something like this in the web UI, back in the mists of 2003 or so, but Joshua got rid of it after a few design iterations.  The Delicious API is still somewhat based on it, which causes some confusionâ€”but I tend to like it, thus this post.
