You know what I've been annoyed by lately?  Those contextual ads masquerading as <a href="http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2006/01/12/no_oss_community.html?page=1" style="border-bottom: 3px double green">double underlined links</a> in the middle of the page.  Aren't these uncomfortably like [Microsoft's Smart Tags][st]?  Eh, maybe not, since the site owners are [willing collaborators][wc]â€”which makes it more of a successful service than a monopolist's sinister plan. 

On the other hand, in the midst of writing this little rant, I noticed that they provide [a mildly hidden opt-out][wc] at the bottom of the FAQ page.  Bah.  It's annoying, but at least there's that.

And, well, folks gotta make money somehow I guess.  [The FAQ page][wc] is very honest about it:
> As we're sure many will appreciate, there is pressure for us to generate revenue from advertising to cover all of the costs, and this is an opportunity for us to do just that.

So, other than the poor user experience of the popup layer when I accidentally roll my mouse over the wrong thing--I can't say they're being crass about it.  

Nonetheless: How long until I get itchy enough to make an anti-IntelliTXT Greasemonkey script, I wonder?
