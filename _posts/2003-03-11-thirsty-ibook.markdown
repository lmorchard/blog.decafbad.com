Just for future reference:  No matter what your cats think, iBooks 
never get thirsty for a nice big tumbler of water.  Nor do they
ever have a need to soak in the contents of said tumbler overnight.
<br /><br />
Although now, I have an expensive, dead laptop that makes white
noise sounds not unlike the ocean when it's plugged in.  And it 
smells like the magic blue smoke when it's let out of the chip.
<br /><br />
I just hope that the hard drive is recoverable.  Updates will be
sporadic as I try to reconstruct my environment and remember passwords
and try to find serial numbers.
<br /><br />
Oh yeah, and still on the trail of the job hunt.  Going to be
tweaking some things around here as I have time, to make things
a bit more presentable for company.
