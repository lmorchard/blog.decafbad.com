I guess the nicest thing, at least with respect to this blog, about [yesterday's new feature release][tg] and the [JSON/XML debate][debate] it tangentially inspired is that it gave me something to blog about.  I've got an impulse to just keep flapping my gums about it, but there's nothing else I've really got to say about it.  Continuing to babble for the sake of it will only get me in trouble.

So, in the interests of trying to break up these repeated lulls here, I've been looking for some reliable writing prompts without much luck.  My [del.icio.us output][del] is steady enough - I thought I might, say, pick one bookmark a day and write something more expansive about it.  That seems not to be working.  I could start picking up on the meme du jour and post survey answers, but then I might as well go back to LiveJournal.  

Of course, I could just accept that I'm an inconstant blogger and not [get into a funk about it][funk].  I still seem to get some reads when I happen to manage a post, so that's cool.

However, unlike writing to a contract or a deadline, my readers here are pretty undemanding.  There's no one tapping a foot, pointing to a watch, asking when the next dozen pages or so are coming.  In fact, if I were to stop blogging altogether and shut down the site, it would probably be awhile before anyone noticed.  This isn't me being emo or anything - this is just how a world full of attractions and attention sinks works.

At this point right now, then, I think I need something somewhat less demanding than another book project, but somewhat more demanding than vague apprehension that people are visiting my site and walking away from stale content.  I really don't care so much about drawing attention as much as getting a regular compulsion to write.  Hell, I haven't even been watching my site stats much in the last few years.  Don't get me wrong:  Having some readers' attention is nice, but it's the writing that I really like.

Hmm, I wonder if that means I'm not *actually* a blogger, per se?  :)
