Oh yeah, and my birthday was yesterdayâ€”say hello to the *big 3-0*.  Other than realizing I've got a few more grey hairs in my goatee and at the temples than I seem to remember at last checkâ€”that is to say, more than noneâ€”I don't feel much older than I did 5 years ago.  That was the last significant birthday, because my car insurance bill dropped.

In other news, believe it or not, it was [my fiancÃ©e's][fian] birthday as well.  Yes, we have the same birthday, though from different years.  (She's very much a youngin' yet.)
