<p>Ack!  I just realized, even though it took two emails make the light go on, that my tarball of <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines">AmphetaOutlines</a> for download in the wiki has still had the broken click-count page bundled for the last month or so.  For some reason I thought that I'd fixed that and re-uploaded the tarball, but no!</p>
<p>So: It's there now, hopefully this is a fix for any of you who tried it and saw the insane refresh loop happen with you clicked on a news item.  Hop on over to <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines">AmphetaOutlines</a> and grab yourself a new copy.</p>
<p>Next...  I screw around with Bayesian filters as applied to incoming news items, categories of interest, and alert levels.  Maybe.</p>
