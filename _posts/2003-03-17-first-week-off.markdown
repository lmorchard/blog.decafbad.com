title: "Happy Trails to Me, I'm Job-Free: Week One"

I hadn't written much last week, between the job search and getting
myself hooked up with a new laptop.  I'd meant to revise my initial
post announcing my being laid of - but instead, I simply lost it
<a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/misc/thirsty_ibook.html" target="_top">when the iBook got doused</a>.
<br /><br />
So, to those of you who haven't heard my news: I was laid off a little
over a week and a weekend ago.  No hard feelings or fireworks, just
typical bad economy reasons.  Nevertheless, it took me by surprise.
So now I'm shopping my resume around.
<br /><br />
If you're interested, my resume is available here:
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/2003/03/l-m-orchard-resume.doc" target="_top">http://www.decafbad.com/2003/03/l-m-orchard-resume.doc</a>

</li>
</ul>
<br /><br />
Last week was strange.  Having been let go on a Friday, I had a
weekend to pretend things were all as usual.  But, when Monday hit,
things were different.  I still got up at the usual time, did the
usual morning things, and got out of the apartment as if I were going
to work.  But instead of heading for the highway, I headed for a
<a href="http://www.espresso-royale.com/locations_detail.cfm?state=Michigan" target="_top">coffee shop</a>
near campus with wireless internet.  Trying to keep the old
patterns as normal as possible, only now my job is finding a job and
getting myself in shape for what's out there.
<br /><br />
It wouldn't be news to anyone to hear that the job market, at least
what I've seen of it so far, is nothing like the verdant plains and
valleys of even 3 years ago - which is about the last time I took a
serious look.  After a first survey of a few job boards online, I
fired off a handful of resumes and apps, and took notes on what's
being asked for so as to prepare some semblance of a learning plan
while I'm off.
<br /><br />
So by the end of last week, I'd accomplished these various and sundry
things:
<ul>
<li> 5 cups of coffee consumed per day
</li>
<li> 1 resume updated and revised
</li>
<li> 6 resumes emailed and 4 online applications filled
</li>
<li> 5 profiles completed at online recruiting sites
</li>
<li> 1 application for unemployment filed
</li>
<li> 1 12" G4 <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/PowerBook?topicparent=Main.FilterData"><b>?</b></a><font color="#0000FF">PowerBook</font></span> acquired and configured
</li>
<li> 3 Microsoft operating systems installed and configured under Virtual PC
</li>
<li> 1 .NET Framework installed and exploration begun
</li>
<li> 1 novel finished, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0872863328/103-7733542-0669406?vi=glance" target="_top">Close to the Machine</a> by Ellen Ullman
</li>
<li> 6 hours of Metroid Prime played
</li>
</ul>
There's been more, but it's the amount of Metroid Prime play I'm most
proud of - had I not gotten out of the apartment in the morning, the
hours invested in that would have been immensely greater.  Maybe after
I've fired off a few more resumes, I'll feel better about actually
taking a rest since my brane's been going full speed for months now at
work.
<br /><br />
Thought a bit about striking out on my own with freelance work, but
the Ellen Ullman book has given me a bit of a strange mood.  She makes
working for oneself sound both promising and desolate at once - though
the promising bits would seem to be the things that disappeared with
the 90's.  So that leaves it sounding pretty unpalatable.  Who knows,
though - I always wanted to work from (but not at) a coffee shop.  
<br /><br />
Well, back to searching and my first baby steps with .NET - wish me
luck.  And if you happen to be in town, stop by and say haloo.
