<p>Chances are good that I'll be attending the <a href="http://hackday.org/">Yahoo! Hack Day in London</a> on June 16th & 17th to offer some <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> representation.  Thanks to my <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/09/18/just-call-me-crash">klutzy bus exit last September</a>, I missed the Hack Day in Sunnyvale with Beck - hopefully a trip to the UK will ameliorate my regret in missing that event.  Now, since I never managed to get one up till now, I need to see about getting a passport in the next 3 weeks.</p>
