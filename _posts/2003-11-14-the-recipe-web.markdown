<p>
So I'm all about this microcontent thing, thinking recently about recipes since reading <a href="http://blogs.it/0100198/2003/11/10.html#a1972">Marc Canter's post</a> about them.  Actually, I've been thinking about them for a couple of years now, since I'd really like to start cooking some decent meals with the web's help.  Oh yeah, and I'm a geek, so tinkering with some data would be fun too.
</p>
<p>
One thing I rarely notice mentioned when ideas like this come up is pre-existing work.  Like <a href="http://www.formatdata.com/recipeml/index.html">RecipeML</a> or even the non-XML MealMaster format.  Both of these have been around for quite a long time, especially so in the case of MealMaster.  In fact, if someone wanted to bootstrap a collection of recipes, you can find <a href="http://www.thehoseys.com/recipes.html">a ton (150,000) of MealMaster recipes</a> as well as <a href="http://dsquirrel.tripod.com/recipeml/indexrecipes.html">a smaller archive (10,000) of RecipeML files</a>.  Of course, I'm not sure about the copyright situation with any of these, but it's a start anyway.
</p>
<p>
But, the real strength in a recipe web would come from cooking bloggers.  Supply them with tools to generate RecipeML, post them on a blog server, and <a href="http://bitsko.slc.ut.us/blog/feed-data.html">index them in an RSS feed</a>.  Then, geeks get to work building the recipe aggregators.  Hell, I'm thinking I might even give this a shot.  Since I'd really like to play with some RDF concepts, maybe I'll write some adaptors to munge RecipeML and MealMaster into <a href="http://donnafales.com/2002/07/28/recipe-schema#">RDF recipe data</a>.  Cross that with FOAF and other RDF whackyness, and build an empire of recipe data.
</p>
<p>
The thing I wonder, though, is why hasn't anyone done this already?  And why hasn't anyone really mentioned much about what's out there already like RecipeML and MealMaster?  It seems like the perfect time to add this into the blogosphere.
