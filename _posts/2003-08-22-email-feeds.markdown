	<p>Internet Mail 2000 starts off with the assumption, &#8220;Mail storage is the sender&#8217;s responsibility.&#8221;  So, you want to send me an email?  Post it on your server and tell me to come &#38; get it.  When I get the notification, I&#8217;ll then decide whether or not I want to bother.  There are a lot of details to fill in here, such as secure posting and retrieval, trust and identity, notification mechanisms.  But, it certainly would seem to balance out the equation a bit.</p>

	<p>How to do it, though, so that things are still at least as simple to use as existing email, such as it is?</p>
