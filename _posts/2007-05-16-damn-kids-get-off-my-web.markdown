<p><a href="http://www.scottburkett.com/index.php/misc/2007-05-08/stop-twittering-and-go-solve-a-problem.html">Scott Burkett, Stop Twittering and Go Solve a Problem</a>: "Aside from aesthetically looking like something a 12 year old cobbled up, the entire tool seems utterly pointless to me."</p>
<p>For Scott, Twitter probably <i>is</i> pointless at first glance.  And that's because no one's talking to him.  Really, this should be a FAQ for all social media, to be read by all journalists and commentators:  Listening in on random strangers' conversations is more likely to be boring than not, and that's what you're doing if you just go to <a href="http://twitter.com">twitter.com</a> and start clicking around.  But, to assume because <i>you're</i> bored that the service as a <i>whole</i> is boring is, again, to be one of the <a href="http://www.noogenesis.com/pineapple/blind_men_elephant.html">Blind Men with an Elephant</a>.</p>
<p>Twitter becomes immensely interesting when it turns out that you've amassed a group of contacts who tend to run in similar circles as you, because even their off-handed remarks and random burps have a decent chance of surfacing something interesting or entertaining.  When it's good, this sets up a nice ambient chatter like sitting in a coffee shop filled with just your kind of people.</p>
<p>This same "I'm bored, so it's boring" mistake has popped up again and again - applied to blogging, MMORPGs, social bookmarking, MySpace, what have you.  Replace "bored/boring" with "confused/confusing" or "annoyed/annoying" and you've got my own early reactions to MySpace.</p>
<p>But, really, it's not <i>addressed to you</i> if there's a buzz and you're not groking it.  That's a clue that you're probably missing something.  Granted, people can be insane, but it really is more likely that you're missing something - even if it's just that there's a particular brand of entertaining insanity in progress to which you're not attuned.</p>
