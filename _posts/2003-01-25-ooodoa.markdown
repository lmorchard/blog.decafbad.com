<blockquote cite="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2002/09/11/log4perl.html?page=1">Log::Log4perl is different. It is a pure Perl port of the widely popular Apache/Jakarta log4j library for Java, a project made public in 1999, which has been actively supported and enhanced by a team around head honcho Ceki G&#252;lc&#252; during the years. 
<p>The comforting facts about log4j are that it's really well thought out, it's the alternative logging standard for Java and it's been in use for years with numerous projects. If you don't like Java, then don't worry, you're not alone -- the Log::Log4perl authors (yours truly among them) are all Perl hardliners who made sure Log::Log4perl is real Perl. </blockquote><div class="credit" align="right"><small>Source:<cite><a href="http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2002/09/11/log4perl.html?page=1">perl.com: Retire your debugger, log smartly with Log::Log4perl! </a></cite>.</small></div></p>
<p>Wow, I hadn't noticed this before.  We've been looking for a Log4J-workalike in for our perl-based web apps at work, and thought <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=all&amp;query=Log::Agent" title="CPAN search for Log::Agent">CPAN:Log::Agent</a> was where it's at - and it still may be - but <a href="http://search.cpan.org/search?mode=all&amp;query=Log::Log4Perl" title="CPAN search for Log::Log4Perl">CPAN:Log::Log4Perl</a> looks very keen now.</p>
