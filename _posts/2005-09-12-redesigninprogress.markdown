Hi there.  If things around here are looking or acting a bit wonky, it's because I'm in the middle of my belated site overhaul I meant to do back in May.  It was preempted by [the book][book], something about which I want to gush in detail very shortly.

In between bouts of actually being busy, I've been yak shaving around the idea of executing this overhaul--making lists, researching sites I like, installing WordPress on my laptop.  Finally, after a bit of a weekend sprint during which I mangled the default theme a bit to my liking and installed a few plugins, I figured that I'd just throw the switch tonight and deal with the fallout as it arrives.

For now, it's bedtime.  But, just for The Girl, here's me with the new book!
