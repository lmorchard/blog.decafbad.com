And of course, Ben of <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType">MovableType</a> is <a href="http://www.stupidfool.org/archives/2002/09/000211.shtml">not unaware of Pingback</a>:<blockquote><i>In current implementations of <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack">TrackBack</a>, the user sending the ping must take some action: either by selecting the post he wishes to send a <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack">TrackBack</a> ping to via a pulldown menu, or by retrieving the ping URL and pasting it into the entry form. And yes, we agree on the point that transparency is the ultimate goal*.
<br /><br />
But note the emphasis on "current implementations"--there is nothing inherent in <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/TrackBack">TrackBack</a> that would prevent an implementation from making it completely transparent.</i></blockquote>Interesting.  Let's see where he goes with this.  He does raise a concern with more automation though:<blockquote><i>* (I do worry slightly about the impact of content management systems fetching and scanning every external link in an entry to determine if it's ping-able. But that's not really the issue.)</i></blockquote>Hmm - I suppose if a site gets heavily referred to, that's a double-Slashdot-effect?  And this investigative process has the potential to add more overhead to the publishing process.  But.. hmm, until I see some convincing <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ConsideredHarmful">ConsideredHarmful</a> arguments, I think the flow producing qualities of this sort of thing are worth it.
