So I've had the daily link posts going for a little while now—long enough to dominate the front page, anyway.  What do you think?  I'm not quite satisfied with them, and I've gotten mixed feedback from people who alternately thing the fresh infusion of posting from me is good, versus others who think the blog is polluted now and looks like a linkspam farm.

I like funneling my del.icio.us posts here because I use them as a sort of sub-aside, a bit like the sentence-wise output of [outline style blogging][osb].  But, of course, that's [not always a good thing][antiosb], though it can be good [when done well (in WordPress)][goodosb] and it definitely has [reached maturity as a style][mature].

I'm thinking I may disable the nightly posts soon and think about swapping over to a better style based on what I originally wanted to do and half-heartedly implemented over on my secret neglected blog [Hacking Feeds][hf].  I've got the cute little coffee bean to use as a bullet point—I originally envisioned the page with a stippled column of them down the left.
