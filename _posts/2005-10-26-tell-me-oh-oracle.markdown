Does anyone out there remember / still participate in the Internet Oracle?

**Update**:  I see the rest of what I'd tried writing here didn't make it into the post.  Anyway, what I meant to say was that the Internet Oracle was one of my first brushes with the fact that there were *people* out there on that Internet.  

I'd been dealing with FTP servers and Archie and reading Usenet archives, but I'd not yet logged on to IRC for the first time.  I'd already had experience with chatting and message bases via dial-up BBSes, but this Internet thing was something altogether more.  So, the Oracle was the first experience I had of sending something out into the void, and getting not an automated response but a wittily-crafted response from an obviously real person.
