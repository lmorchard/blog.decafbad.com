> That's all I have to say about the matter, though I do find it strange that people would complain about and try to dictate what I put on my eponymous web site. You can just stop reading if you'd like. You don't need to tell me about it.

There are a handful or two of bloggers to whose feeds I'm subscribed who occasionally post things to which I'm vehemently opposed—right-wing US politics, certain religious stances, etc.  But for the most part, I seem to agree with them the rest of the time.  Seems like we might like the same technologies, maybe the same TV shows and music.

Sometimes I think it's a really strange thing, to be so similar yet so different.  But, usually, I just smile and nod and move on—there's no sense in trying to convert someone on their own blog, if there's even a way to convert them in the first place.

And besides, I don't even like the idea of trying to induce a conversion in the first place—best thing to do is just meet in peace on whatever common grounds exist.  And, if there's any changing of opinions in the cards, it'll happen naturally.  Which assumes, of course, that you're dealing with rational actors.  When you're not, that's when you may need to revisit your strategy and likely walk away.
