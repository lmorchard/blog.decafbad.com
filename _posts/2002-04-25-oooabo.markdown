title: Can ZOE make my mail intertwingly?

<p>Via <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0106939/2002/04/24.html#a7">Prof Avery</a>, I just found <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/zoe_info/Resume3.html">ZOE</a>.<blockquote><i>The goal here is to do for email (starting with your personal mailbox) what Google did for the web... The Google principle: It doesn't matter where information is because I can get to it with a keystroke.</p>
<p>So what is Zoe? Think about it as a sort of librarian, tirelessly, continuously, processing, slicing, indexing, organizing, your messages. The end result is this intertwingled web of information. Messages put in context. Your very own knowledge base accessible at your fingertip. No more "attending to" your messages. The messages organization is done automatically for you so as to not have the need to "manage" your email. Because once information is available at a keystroke, it doesn't matter in which folder you happened to file it two years ago. There is no folder. The information is always there. Accessible when you need it. In context.</i></blockquote></p>
<p>Rock on!  I'm either terribly unoriginal or my mind is being read or there's just a common Alpha Geek wavelength I'm tuning into.  By the description, this is <b>precisely</b> what I wanted to do with a <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PersonalMailServer">PersonalMailServer</a>.  Getting tired of making folders, filtering rules, and <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PersonalMailServer">MailToRSS</a> needs a bit more work and tweaking to be really useful.  </p>
<p>From <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/zoe_info/Education6.html">the FAQ</a>:<blockquote><i>Q: On which platform does ZO? run?</p>
<p>A: ZO? has been known to run on the following "platforms":<br />
...<br />
<a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MacOSX">MacOSX</a> 10.1.4, jre 1.3.1, Mozilla 0.9.9<br />
...</i></blockquote>Rock on.<blockquote><i>Q: How much does ZO? cost?</p>
<p>A: ZO? is free of charge for personal usage. Keep in mind, that you are getting what you are paying for... ;-)</i></blockquote>Rock on.<blockquote><i>Q: Is ZO? open source?</p>
<p>A: No.</i></blockquote>Awwww.  That's no fun!  I want to play!  I don't see it within 5 minutes of installation, but I think this thing really really needs IMAP.  IMAP would rock for both message import and external mail client access.</p>
<p>But, from the author's terse response to this question, I'm imagining there are many who've asked it and he's tired of answering why he's not being trendy :)  I guess I'll play and see what happens.</p>
