title: Got your music store butting into my library

New iTunes update, v6.0.2.  First impression:  Apple, get your damn music store out of my personal library.  When I use the browsing interface—as I usually do—it takes up a full third of my visible space on this 12" screen.  The only saving grace is that at least the store pane disappears when I view my iPod library.  

Oh!  I just discovered that I can get rid of the pane if I disable the Music Store altogether using the Parental controls under preferences.  Well, that's gone now... I guess this impulse-enabling "improvement" was a shot aimed at their own feet:  If I ever want to buy from iTMS again, I'll have to go through the trouble to re-enable it.
