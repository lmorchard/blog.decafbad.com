 <p><a href="http://www.neowin.net/index.php?act=view&id=32462">Here's yet another example of why I have a lot of angst for IntelliTXT advertising.</a>  Unfortunately, I've not activated my adblock or <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/01/13/i-cant-get-too-ticked-at-oreilly-and-intellitxt">opted out</a> for this site.  Can you tell me which of these links are the real links to the relevant content about which this news story is written?  It's about a new SDK from AOL for AIM.</p>
 <p>The AOL link goes to AOL, at least, but the rest are all either to competitors or nonsequitors - "SDK" links to something about barcodes?!  Oh, but when I look closer, I can tell that the actual site's links are in a non-underlined light blue style.</p>
 <p>This is pathetic:  There are more contextual ad links - which aren't actually well-contextualized - than there are real links.  Oh, and have I mentioned the agency behind IntelliTXT has attempted to contact me through email and IM to discuss opportunities for decafbad.com?  Do you know how much it pains me to simply ignore it and not turn around and spew pure bile at them?  No thanks guys - I don't <i>really</i> want to offend you, but this service offends <i>my</i> sensibilities.</p>
