In my intermittent online presence, I've been happily watching <a href="http://www.scripting.com" target="_top">Dave Winer</a>'s
ramp-up with <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/OPML">OPML</a> toward OSCON with things like 
"<a href="http://www.opml.org/howToImplementOpmlDirectoryBrowser" target="_top">How to implement an <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/OPML">OPML</a> directory browser</a>".
I love outliners, and though it's been a little while since I played with Radio, I loved Instant Outlining
and the <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/ooocoe.html" target="_top">transclusion</a> of outside outlines into the
one at hand via URL.  And when Dave first introduced the idea of an <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/OPML">OPML</a>-based distributed web directory,
I figured it was the start of another nifty twist in the web fabric.  (You know, the kind that makes wrinkles?
The kind of wrinkles that make brains smarter?)
<br /><br />
Anyway, even given all this, <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/OPML">OPML</a> has always bugged me, and I'm not alone.  In fact, today I found a
link to <a href="http://oml.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">OML</a>, the Outline Markup Language project on <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/SourceForge?topicparent=Main.FilterData"><b>?</b></a><font color="#0000FF">SourceForge</font></span>,
which seems to seek to address many of the same things that have bugged me.  That is, things like
<a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand">UserLand</a> application-specific tags, and extension via arbitrary attributes.  Though I'm no master
of deep XML magic, these things struck me as grungy.
<br /><br />
But you know, we're <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/oooced.html" target="_top">designing for recombinant growth with the lazyweb</a> here
(or at least, Dave Winer was and is), and <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/OPML">OPML</a> looks like one of those dirty things that got
thrown together quickly in order to enable a laundry list of further projects.  It works, isn't
all that hard to grasp, and has gotten adopted quickly.  There's momentum there.  As 
<a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/2003/04/15#noWaitForTools" target="_top">Dave says</a>, there is no wait for
tools.
<br /><br />
So, now there's also <a href="http://oml.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">OML</a> starting.  Hopefully this won't become another rehash of the <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> fight.  
Because, I sense many similar issues between the two.  Maybe it would have been better still if OML had been named something
completely avoiding the letters O, P, M, or L.  I already see mailing list charters being called out in order to quiet unwanted
discussion of fundamentals, but, hopefully we can avoid anyone claiming that they have the One True Format, all fighting for the
same name and slapping each other around with version numbers.  Gah.
<br /><br />
Anyway.  I like OML but see some grunge in it as well.  At the moment, I'm using an <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/OPML">OPML</a>-supporting tool. I can't imagine that
conversion would be more than an XSLT file away.  Well, maybe more than that.  Beyond that, let's agree to disagree and viva le
fork.  Let the best, most demonstratably capable format win.  Meanwhile, I'm still considering that Tinderbox license to see if I
might like multi-dimensional outlining...
