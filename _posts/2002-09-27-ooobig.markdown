Quick update to <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTCleanHTMLPlugin">MTCleanHTMLPlugin</a>:  renamed the directory <code>extdir</code> in the tarball to <code>extlib</code>, which is what it should have been for easy drop-in installation.  Thanks to <a href="http://www.inluminent.com/weblog/">John of illuminent.com</a>, whose weblog gets me funny looks at work.  :)
