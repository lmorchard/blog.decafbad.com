<blockquote cite="http://backend.userland.com/permalinksNewsAggregators">Guids sure have a funny name, but they're quite useful. If your weblog tool supports them, use them. If not, ask the developer to add the support. It's not very hard.
<br /><br />
Further, I strongly believe that all aggregators and readers should pay attention to guids where they are available. It's a convenience that many users will appreciate, especially people who are in a hurry</blockquote>

Haven't really been saying much lately about the recent plunge, albeit more amiable this time, back
into the <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> and weblog syndication frey.  Mostly because I haven't had the time, and mostly because
people more eloquent than I were already saying what I thought.
<br /><br />
In the meantime, I've been working, and puttering around with 
<a href="http://www.decafbad.com/viewcvs.cgi/dbagg/" target="_top">my own aggregator</a> as spare time comes up.
And you know, I'm tired of having to come up with some mechanism to detect new entries.
This GUID thing is what I need.  I don't want to run MD5 on another <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> item, and I don't
care to track the minor edits people do on their entries, like Dave said.
<br /><br />
Personally, I think the GUID <strong>should</strong> be the permalink, if at all possible.  I used 
to think that that was what the link of an <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> item should be, but then I never really
maintained a weblog in the quote-link-comment style for long stretches.  My entries
aren't usually completely <strong>about</strong> someone else's article.  But, some weblogs are 
like that.  So, link points to a subject under comment, GUID identifies the entry and
ideally does it via permalink.
<br /><br />
Nifty.
