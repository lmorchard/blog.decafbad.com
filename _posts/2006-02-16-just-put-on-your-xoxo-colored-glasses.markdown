 <p>A couple of years ago, I said <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2004/05/03/put-on-your-rss-colored-glasses-and-forget-about-atom">"Put on your RSS-colored glasses and forget about Atom</a>."  (Wow, has it been that long?)  Well, right now I'm saying this:  Put on your XOXO-colored glasses and forget about OPML.</p>
 <p>Here's an outline snagged from my OPML blog today: <a href="http://decafbad.com/2006/02/20060216.opml">http://decafbad.com/2006/02/20060216.opml</a></p>
 <p>Now, here's that outline in some semblance of XOXO: <a href="http://decafbad.com/2006/02/20060216.xoxo">http://decafbad.com/2006/02/20060216.xoxo</a></p>
 <p>Here's the XSLT that I used to transform from OPML to XOXO: <a href="http://decafbad.com/2005/11/gopher-ng/opml-to-xoxo.xsl">http://decafbad.com/2005/11/gopher-ng/opml-to-xoxo.xsl</a></p>
 <p>And, here's the mod_rewrite chicanery I threw together to facilitate this: <a href="http://decafbad.com/2006/02/rewrite-rules.txt">http://decafbad.com/2006/02/rewrite-rules.txt</a></p>
 <p>I think my XSLT could use some work to better conform to XOXO, and I still need to get a PHP- or module-based XSLT processor for around here for efficiency's sake.  But, this seems like it might be a way to provide XOXO-colored glasses to visitors who don't like the cut of my OPML.  Does anyone have an RDF-based outline format for me to use?  I could throw that in, too.</p>
 <p>Is there anything I'm missing here that makes this idea suck completely?</p>
