So, it finally happened—[I've been tagged by Stephen Donner][stephend].  I've not been one to follow memes in this blog, but this one's been going around the [Mozillasphere][] for awhile now and has been kind of interesting.  I'm half-tempted to bookmark and tag all the entries I've caught so far.  Anyway, the rules:

1. [Link to your original tagger(s)][stephend] and list these rules in your post.
2. Share seven facts about yourself in the post.
3. <strike>Tag seven people at the end of your post by leaving their names and the links to their blogs.</strike>
4. <strike>Let them know they’ve been tagged.</strike>

Now, for your random facts, after the jump:

5. My wife is a nerd, who tracked me down via a user name shown in the webcam picture I used for my Yahoo! Personals ad, in order to avoid paying to reply.  [Dial-up BBSes and DOOR games played a part in our courtship][doorgames].
2. We have [two ocicats][ocicats], littermates named [Puck][puck] and [Inanna][inanna].  They're both [very cute][cute] and are [more awesome][awesome] than anyone else's cats. 
3. I have [sleep apnea][apnea], and use [a CPAP machine][cpap] every night.  [If you snore, go get tested][snore].  Heart disease, [of which my snoring father died][dad], is one of many possible consequences of untreated sleep apnea.
4. [Although I have been a computer nerd since the age of 7][newly], I had the wild notion in starting college that I wanted to be [a journalist][ratreview] or a psychologist.  Luckily, the web took off during my freshman year, which let me be a little of all the above.  [I'm not sure why I ever thought I'd be anything other than a computer nerd][growup].
6. I'm [a complete introvert][introvert] and though I work hard at being sociable, I need a day or two alone for every half-day or so spent being social.  My main coping mechanism since even before my teenage years was to make friends from behind a keyboard and screen, and the internet has made that even more scalable as I've grown up.  And now, I get to work that way too—HUGE SUCCESS!
1. In my senior year of High School, I won 2nd place in [the Ayn Rand Institute's *The Fountainhead* essay contest][essay].  This was the culmination of having read every scrap of Ayn Rand's writing I could get my hands on throughout High School.  I used the money to take a summer trip to visit a friend who'd moved to Texas and to buy my [well used, now dead palmtop PC][palmtop].
7. I like extremely hot spicy food, insanely hop-saturated beer, Irish whiskey, and fresh locally roasted coffee.

[Per Ben Hearsum][ben], I think I'll make this a leaf node in the meme spanning the [Mozillasphere][].  In a quick 5 minute search, it looks like most blogging Mozillans have already been tagged, and I'm not going to spread the contagion outside the organization.  :)
