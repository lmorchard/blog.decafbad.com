 <p>So, I'm idly musing about <a href="http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/thread.jspa?messageID=36690&tstart=0#36690">an AJAX-based S3 file manager</a> and it occurs to me:  I don't know how to do file uploads via AJAX PUT requests.  Is there any way to get access to a local file selected in an input element in a form?  That'd sure make a nice alternative to pasting data into a big textarea.</p>
