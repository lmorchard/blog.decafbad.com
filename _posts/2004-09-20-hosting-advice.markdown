Now that I've just moved over to this JohnCompanies hosting, I'm realizing several things:

* Virtual dedicated hosting on a shared box is not nearly the same as having your own box.
* While I mostly know what I'm doing, I do have a bit to learn about tweaking a linux server.
* I don't know a good deal in hosting when I see it.

Mainly, I think it's that whatever I'm doing with FeedReactor is intermittently killing this box.  But I suspect it's worse than that, though this surprises me since when last I used JohnCompanies, I was used to rock solid service-- so I have to assume the instability is my fault.  (I keep hitting memory limits that result in random failures and malloc denials.)

I've had several generous offers to host my experiments and I, but eventually, I think I should just rent my own dedicated hardware somewhere.  Anyone have some good advice on where and how much?

So far I'm looking at:

* <http://www.ev1servers.net/> (Thanks to [Imajes](http://imajes.info/))
* <http://www.serverbeach.com/>

Maybe someday soon I'll come up with something that would justify and fund decent hosting.  In the meantime, I'm hoping for something around US$100 or less that doesn't die all the time.
