<p>Hmm... now that I finally stopped babbling and read the docs, I just noticed that the <a href="http://www.google.com/apis">Google APIs</a> has methods to access their cache.</p>
<p>Sounds like I need to write a personal HTTP proxy that includes "404 Correction" by consulting Google's cache whenever one encounters a 404.  Could be a new project, too, since someone I was talking to wanted searchable personal web browsing history and I think a personal HTTP proxy could help with that.<br />
