I've really got to reiterate / call out a few points from [that last entry][tle]:

  * I &#10084; [making feed scrapers][scrapers], although they're sometimes a pain.
  * I &#10084; [Microformats][], for making scrapers easy.
  * I &#10084; [Ficlets][] for using [Microformats][] and making it easy for me to use their [site as an API][siteapi] using just XSL and HTTP GET.
   
I'd love to see more sites like [Ficlets][].
