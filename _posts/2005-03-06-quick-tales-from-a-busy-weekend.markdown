* I wish I could find a cheap iPod car installation kit for my 2004 Ford Focus.  

  No, not a lighter adapter for power and an iTrip--I already have those.  I want one of those snazzy boxes that jack the iPod in as a CD changer.  However, not only do they tend to cost as much as an iPod, but no one seems to offer one for my 2004 Ford Focus.  :(

* Why on Earth does the [Google API][gapi] use Julian dates?

  I could understand using Julian if, maybe, you wanted to catch things published before the birth of Christ.  But, I would think that seconds since the Unix epoch would be more than adequate for anything web-related.
  
  But then again, I really don't know much about dates.

[gapi]: http://www.google.com/apis/

* Also... it's been awhile since last I played with the [Google API][gapi].  What, no REST API?  I was having fun with the Amazon and Yahoo APIs today, then ran into a wall of SOAP when I visited Google.
