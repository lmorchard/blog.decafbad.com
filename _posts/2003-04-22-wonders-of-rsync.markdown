I take rsync for granted.  It's just the best way to keep stuff <i>out there</i>
up to date with stuff <i>over here</i>, and vice versa.  And lately, I've been
using it to supplant my usage of <code>scp</code>.  And it works.  Brilliantly.  And until
recently, I hadn't stopped to realize:  Hey, you know, this thing somehow works
out differences between files <i>out there</i> and <i>over here</i> long <i>before</i>
what's <i>here</i> gets <i>there</i>.  I know, duh, but I just hadn't considered it.

Well,
<a href="http://weblog.bluepenguin.us/archives/2003/04/22/rsync_one_of_the_wonders_of_the_cs_world.html" target="_top">Paul Holbrook reminded me</a>
of this tonight, with links to <a href="http://samba.anu.edu.au/~tridge/" target="_top">Andrew Tridgell</a>'s
paper on the algorithm, among other things.  Damn, things like this remind me
that I'm supposed to be getting my butt back into school...
