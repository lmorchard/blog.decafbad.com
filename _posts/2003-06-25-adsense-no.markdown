Hmph.  No chat around here.  I suppose things are a little personal, and there's a search
engine.  But, if there be warez here, I must've been hacked, and nobody seems to want
this domain but me, so there doesn't seem to be any squatting going on.

Guess I'm not a web publisher who wants to make more revenue while maintaining editorial
quality.  :)  (I'm guessing I've been rejected as a web publisher.)
