<p>I'm glad to see that I'm <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/16286">not</a> <a href="http://mikel.org/2002_04_07_mikelarch.html#75326362">the only</a> <a href="http://aaronland.info/weblog">one</a> who doesn't quite yet get an immediate <i>eureka</i> about the new <a href="http://www.google.com/apis">Google APIs</a>-- searching in particular.  Of course there are the non-web crossovers, like <a href="http://www.interconnected.org/home/more/googlematic.gif">searching in AIM via googlematic</a>, but this mostly makes me yawn.  Yes, its fun and geeky, but yawn.  This is not to say that the Google search API itself makes me yawn.</p>
<p>What makes me yawn is anything that's just an alternative direct user interface on the service.  Search from my IDE while I program?  Eh, that's okay, but I could do that by just spawning a browser with a cooked URL and not have to re-engineer a UI do display the results.  Display some results of a canned search in my weblog?  Eh, that's cute, but I could do that with some simple HTML scraping and <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/SSI">SSI</a>, if I really really wanted to.  Yeah, I know the web service makes that <i>so</i>much easier, but the thing it makes easier isn't something I was really interested in the first place.  Maybe I'm not interested because I don't get it yet, or maybe it really is just a novel triviality.</p>
<p>No, what will make my overhead lightbulb spark up are applications which involve indirection.  That is, some application which makes searches to answer some other question of mine.  Search results used to spawn further churning.  Or, search results as the result of churning.  Google's suggestions are intriguing: Auto-monitor the web for new information on a subject; Glean market research insights and trends over time; Invent a catchy online game.  But, these sound disappointingly close to a corp-speak shrug.  </p>
<p>Not that this is unexpected or a bad thing or a statement of derision.  Their Alpha Geeks made the service available, and now its up to the world Alpha Geeks to turn it into magic.  I'm just waiting and thinking though...  the AG's are churning out all permutations of language bindings, alternative interfaces, and weavings of the service into other apps.  This is the first stage of play.  I don't know that I'll feel like playing much yet.  So I'll watch, and maybe tinker a bit, but mostly be thinking about what the next stage of play will become.</p>
