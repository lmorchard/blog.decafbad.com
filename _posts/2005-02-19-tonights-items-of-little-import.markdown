Here goes nothing--atomic bullet points to power, quickie turbines to speed...

* [Pyjamarama][pyjamarama] is my song of the evening.

* I've gotten hooked on [Vim][vim], having defected from [xemacs][xemacs], because I like keeping more of my user interface in my headspace and [adopting modes as fighting stances][vimstances].

* I haven't been paying attention to my web stats.  Does anyone out there actually read and enjoy [my links][links], since I split them out of the main blog?  (Just curious.)

* I've been thinking lately that my innate fashion instincts come from the [Tom Baker era of Doctor Who][drwho].  Thankfully, I have a girlfriend who helps dress me.  The hair's still getting pretty unruly, though.

* [Quick News][qn] is the [NetNewsWire][nnw] of the Palm OS world.  It can even download podcasts!  *And it's only $15 bucks!*

* [Primus says][primus]:<blockquote>
Funny thing about weekends when you&#8217;re unemployed.<br />
They don&#8217;t quite mean so much,<br />
Except you get to hang out with all your working friends.
</blockquote>
