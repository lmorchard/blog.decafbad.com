title: no amazon iframes for me

So here's a problem that's cropped up for me lately.  I think it came with the upgrade to [WP 2.0][wp2].  I'm trying to include some Amazon-provided iframes in the sidebar for continue book pimping, which worked fine with my WP 1.5 installation.  But now, for some reason, the iframes are always forced into a <code>display: none</code> style and I can't figure out what's doing it.

*Update:*  Now is the time on 0xDECAFBAD when the head meets desk.  Adblock is the culprit.  Oof.
