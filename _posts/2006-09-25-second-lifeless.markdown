*Update:*  By the way, I'm Les Ofarrel in Second Life.  Drop me a note sometime. :)

A few times during my couchbound past couple of weeks, I've jumped into Second Life.  The place both overwhelms and underwhelms me.  I'm overwhelmed because it's so wide open, and I have no idea where to start or go.  I'm underwhelmed because so much of it looks cruddy and is always in the process of loading.  My assumption is that I've just not yet grokked the magic bits yet.  The place is usually empty when I wander in, wherever I wander in - and I have no idea where I've been, really.  A few times I've stumbled onto something smutty, which doesn't interest me in the slightest.  I'm not interested in gambling either.

So, a request, if you please:  Send me somewhere interesting.  Give me coordinates, or a link, or whatnot.  Thank you kindly!
