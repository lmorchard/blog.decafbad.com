Know what I just realized?  [Canvas][] [has][ff] [arrived][saf] in all the browsers I care about daily, and I see a hack [brewing][ie] for that other one for which I don't care so much.  

I suppose sometime soon, when free time comes, I should revisit my [box dragging demo][drag] and ditch that clunky transparent GIF deformation crap I'd tried refining last summer.  

I wonder: Does a canvas play well in layers with other page elements?
