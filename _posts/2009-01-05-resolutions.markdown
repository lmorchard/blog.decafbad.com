So, [after all that][review], I suppose the thing to do for a new year is to figure out what's next, maybe compose some disposable resolutions for the coming months. Well, here are some off the top of my head:

* Spend time with my lovely wife.
* Eat less, move more.
* Write more.
* Be a valuable contributor at Mozilla.
* Make a few new friends.
* Spend time with friends.
* Paint the front porch.
* Treat the back deck.
* Reseed the lawn.
* Maybe grow a garden.
* Maybe learn Haskell.

Note that most of what's happened in my life [over the past 3 years][review] is missing from that list.
