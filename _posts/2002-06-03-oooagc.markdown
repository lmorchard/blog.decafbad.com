<p>I'm thinking of getting a digital camera.  Price is a concern, but mostly my concern is small size and pocket-ability.  I want this to sit in my jeans pocket, maybe my coat pocket, and take somewhat decent images.  I'm not quite as concerned about super high-res and printable images, as I am about capturing 50-100 decently bloggable images (~640x480 and smaller?).  I want a device inobtrusive enough to keep with me at all times, so I can pull it out in the moment, and capture what I usually miss.  And preferrably without needing a Batman-like utility belt.  I don't really like that style anymore.</p>
<p>Basically I want to start a bit of a personal photo journal blog.  That's photo album enough for me.</p>
<p>So how about this camera to start?</p>

<p>I've held this one in my hands, and it feels good and small, yet seems to more than satisfy the performance I want out of it.  I've also looked at the <a href="http://www.dynamism.com/spyz/index.shtml">Spyz</a>, <a href="http://www.dynamism.com/cubik/index.shtml">Cubik</a>, <a href="http://www.dynamism.com/eyeplate/index.shtml">Eyeplate</a>, and one or two other tiny cameras, but they seem to be too under powered for what I want, in terms of memory.  And they also seem <i>cheap</i>.  Then again, I haven't held any of those in my hands.  And then again, again, cheap might be good if it's banging around in my pocket.</p>
<p>I'm sure I'm not the only person thinking of doing this, or already doing this.  Any one have some pointers for me?</p>
