Okay, no.  
<br /><br />
<a href="http://www.samsungtelecom.com/matrix/">This new Matrix-inspired phone</a> is ugly as hell and not cool at all.  Do they actually use this thing in the movie?  I hope this isn't a sign for what the movie will be like -- clumsy, bulky, cartoonish and not at all subtle like the original.  See, the first movie had a phone.  I forget the model number, but I think it was a Nokia.  its sliding keypad cover was modified especially for the movie with a switchblade-springload action for extra cool factor.  And, unlike a lot of phones at the time, it was slick and sleek and tiny.
<br /><br />
So what the hell is this thing?  It looks like a walkee-talkee for grade school kids, not the "ultimate conversation piece".
