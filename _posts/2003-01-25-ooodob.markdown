<blockquote cite="http://snowdeal.org/section/ex_machina/archives/2003_01_19_index.html#90233272">interestingly, it seems that besides myself there are a goodly number of people wondering about the etiquette surrounding foaf friend declaration. while it's mostly a social and not technical problem, it's precisely the sort of thing that will keep foaf from reaching any kind of critical mass. </blockquote><div class="credit" align="right"><small>Source:<cite><a href="http://snowdeal.org/section/ex_machina/archives/2003_01_19_index.html#90233272">snowdeal.org, ex machina</a></cite>.</small></div>
<p>I've wondered a bit about this, too.  If I've <strong>heard</strong> of you, can I list you as a friend?  If I've emailed you once or twice?  How about if I've dated your sister?</p>
<p>However, Eric Vitiello Jr. has <a href="http://www.perceive.net/schemas/20021119/relationship/" target="_top">an interesting schema for further specifying relationships</a> in <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FOAF">FOAF</a>.</p>
