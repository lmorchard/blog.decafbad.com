So, after reading a [comment from Brian Cors][cb] and wandering by [his site][hs] again, I've suddenly gotten more interested in the [Hemingway][hw] theme for [WordPress][wp].  One problem, though:  Although the [WordPress Widgets][ww] plugin (about which [I've raved][ir]) was based on [Hemingway][hw]'s Blocks feature, it's not apparently compatible.  So, anyone know how to make it compatible, or where I can get more Hemingway blocks?

*Update:*  Actually, Hemingway blocks look pretty easy to make, and the [inlineRSS][irss] plugin makes for easy external site integration so I can pull my output together here.  Now, if I can just get around the bugs in word-count-limited front page excerpts with Markdown.
