 <p>It's official - on June 9th, <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/17/were-engaged">the girl and I are to be married</a>.  From June 11th until the 14th, we plan to explore San Francisco to kick off our honeymoon.</p>
 <p>We've each been to San Francisco individually, but only long enough to know we liked the place.  At this point, we're scouring reviews and resources to get some idea of an itinerary.</p>
 <p>So, I have this favor to ask of you, dear readers:  If you were to have a honeymoon in San Francisco, what would be the absolute not-to-miss necessities?  We're looking for great eats, nifty fun, and stuff not found in the AAA guide.  Give us the local scoop.  Think about the things you'd do, if you had a chance to really splurge.</p>
 <p>I'd be really grateful for any and all suggestions you might have!</p>
