By the way, <a href="http://mysteryrobot.com/cgi/namber?address=www.decafbad.com" target="_top">Namber DNS</a> at mysteryrobot.com (found via <a href="http://www.diaweblog.org" target="_top">DiaWebLog</a>) is damn nifty.  As I understand it, it works from a set of 256 very short and simple words.  Assemble four of these, and you can represent any IP address.  Seems like this would make for very easily remembered IP addresses, as well as fairly simple to recite over the phone.
For example: decafbad.com is <a href="http://sing.far.dry.today.mysteryrobot.com" target="_top">sing.far.dry.today.mysteryrobot.com</a>
