There's a guy here in our office building who wanders around endlessly talking on a Bluetooth headset.  He does this all day long and in a variety of localesâ€”including while standing at the urinal in our floor's shared restroom.  But, I've never actually seen him interact with people in real proximity to him:  He just sort of paces and drifts around like some sort of between-worlds spirit.  Sometimes I wonder if he might not just be more comfortable doing this sort of thing at home, or while feeding the birds in a nice park somewhere...
