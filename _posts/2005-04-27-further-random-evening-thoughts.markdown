* "*The Modern with the warrior, the mean with the stride, the Tom with the sawyer, And the mean, mean, mean, mean pride.*" 

  [Mindless Self Indulgence][msi] has done the best deconstruction of [Rush][rush]'s Tom Sawyer I've ever heard.  I'm still bouncing after numerous obsessive replays.

* Ecto, OmniWeb, Colloquy, Firefox, NetNewsWire.  There are just far too many icons on my dock based on globe imagery.  I can't find any links, but I swear someone made just this observation not too long ago.  

  I mean, come on, I understand that the internet is world wide and has global reach and all that--but can I get a little more variation in icon design here?  :)  At least Safari's compass gives a nod back to the "Navigator" theme from *ye olden days* of Netscape.  
  
  Can I get a different overall shape at least?  A triangle or trapezoid, maybe?  These all tend to smudge into vague circles at low magnification, or in the pre-coffee morning hours.  I'd be fine if NNW dropped the globe and stuck with the satellite.  Colloquy might be cool just as a funky megaphone.  And, maybe ecto could play up that pen theme.
  
  Ah well--I wouldn't be grousing if I didn't rely on these apps daily.
