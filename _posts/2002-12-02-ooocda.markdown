This really confuses me.  Seems that I've gotten 2 pieces of comment spam on one of my more visible blog entries (due to controversy) from back in September, <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000278.phtml">More on the Monster Mash</a>.  The first one expresses confusion, then links to something about zip codes, and links again to something about business plans.  The second one is apparently a strange flame at <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DaveWiner">DaveWiner</a>, then links to something about vehicle history reports.
<br /><br />
I'll likely delete these in a lil while, but it really confuses me.  Do things like this really bring in financial results to the spammers?  Random links in nonsensical comments and inappropriate flames?  Do they really have some metrics on this, before &amp; after spam revenue results?  This, and other spam, is really seeming like <a href="http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Skinner/Pigeon/">superstition in pigeons</a>, where various kinds of spam are tried and maybe money is made so more kinds of spam are tried until the oddest forms appear.
<br /><br />
I really do hope that, some day, the full fury of hell and recipients of spam scorned rain down on the heads of all those slimy bastards.
