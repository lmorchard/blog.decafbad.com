 <p>Scoping out <a href="http://ma.gnolia.com">Ma.gnolia</a> a bit today, and I've noticed a few <a href="http://ma.gnolia.com/people/IraGlass">rather</a> <a href="http://ma.gnolia.com/people/AltonBrown">famous</a> - and decidedly <a href="http://ma.gnolia.com/people/TedAllen">non-tech geek</a> - people have accounts there.  This has me scratching my head a bit:  Are these people friends of the site owners?  Spontaneous fans of this site's brand of social bookmarking?  Paid shills playing the tables?  Seeing these sorts of faces showing up at an up-till-now all-alpha-geek party seems a bit suspect to me.  It also seems rather non-<a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/02/09/a-long-tailed-creative-yawp">long-tailed</a> and celeb-attached to me.  But then, I'm weird and it could be all on the up and up.  The site does look like a brave effort toward making this stuff intentionally more "humane".</p>

<b>Update:</b> Got <a href="http://www.haloscan.com/comments/lmorchard/2006_2F02_2F19_23When_3A8_3A28_3A28PM/#2526">a nifty response from Todd Sieling of Ma.gnolia</a>, with respect to <a href="http://blogs.opml.org/decafbad/2006/02/19#When:8:28:28PM">my Ma.gnolia concerns</a>: <i>You can lay your suspicions to rest. We've been talking with these folks for quite a while both before and through beta, gauging interest and letting them know how social bookmarking can help them engage with their audiences in a new way that is more dynamic than a brochure website. Their appearance at launch was to make launch a bit more special. And, for what it's worth, alpha geeks haven't made up all the early members in Ma.gnolia. Designers, photographers and more casual web users have been part of the mix as well.</i>
