<p>It's a small bloggy world:  I just noticed a few referral hits from <a href="http://www.razorsoft.net/weblog/">Peter Drayton</a>, whose <a href="http://www.razorsoft.net/weblog/2002/04/10.html#a101">book</a> I just bought this weekend.  <i>Hi there! :)</i></p>
<p>Now if I just had some .NET and C# love on my iBook.  This seems like a vaguely heretical thought to me.</p>
