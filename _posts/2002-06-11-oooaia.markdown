title: (Re)defining the News Aggregator

<p>Reading Dave's in-progress <a  href="http://radio.userland.com/whatIsANewsAggregator">What is a News Aggregator?</a>:<blockquote><i> A news aggregator is a piece of software that periodically reads a set of news sources, in one of several XML-based formats, finds the new bits, and displays them in reverse-chronological order on a single page.</i></blockquote>..and the rest leads from there.  First thing:  I think this is an unfortunately limited definition.  It specifies the particular interface by which <a href="http://radio.userland.com">Radio</a> presents information.  And, as a comment on <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000187.phtml">one of my first experments</a> in tweaking <a href="http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/">AmphetaDesk</a>'s interface attests (no author link):<blockquote><i>I've been wanting to use an aggregator since I first heard of them (RU7) but have always felt that because poor information architecture/presentation they tended to make tracking a large number of sites harder rather than easier.</i></blockquote>I didn't expect my first attempt to be called "Brilliant! Lovely! Perfect!", but I did think that I was on to something.  Simply displaying the new bits in reverse-chronological order is too limiting - it's only one attempted solution at the problem of aggregation.  My solution isn't an ultimate one either.  </p>
<p>Aggregators desperately need to grow toward more flexibility and scan-ability.  A few things I'd really like to see addressed:<ul><li>De-emphasis of seen &amp; older items from sites, but not complete hiding.  Context between entries on weblogs is important.</li><li>Optional grouping of items from the same or similar weblogs.  Context between entries, and between blogs is important.</li><li>Emphasis of newer items, tracking the time line and signalling attention to changes.  Radio does this, but mostly to the exclusion of other concerns.</li><li>Preventing sites with few updates from getting lost in a wash of frequently updating sites.  Some of the best sites may update once every few days with something worth reading, but simple reverse-chronological order pushes the quiet sites out in the maelstrom.</li></ul>There's more I've been musing about, but I can't remember more at the moment.  I've tried to do a few of these things with my tweak to Ampheta: varied (hopefully not obtrusive) font size &amp; weight, dependant on item age; maintaining grouping and order of items within <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> feeds; showing enough information for a visual scan, hiding further details, but making details available within a click or two (I love outlines).  I wanted to hit the page-down button less, but it's more than that.  I want my eyes to move slow on the first few items of a channel, and then slide down off the rest, unless I intentionally want to be caught.</p>
<p>So, while Dave's working on defining the News Aggregator, I think it's a good time to redefine it a bit while he's at it.</p>
