<p><a href="http://www.tuxmachines.org/node/21069">Wine is Getting Good</a>: "<i>Anyone else notice lately how good Wine is getting?</i>"</p>
<p>I haven't checked <a href="http://www.winehq.org">Wine</a> out in awhile, but I'm a big fan.  I <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2002/05/30/oooafh">was using it</a> to run <a href="http://radio.userland.com/">Radio UserLand</a> under Linux, about 5 years ago.  (Wow, has it been that long?)  I've kind of assumed that Wine would get Good Enough at some point to run almost everything that matters that was written for Win95, Win98, Win2K, and eventually even WinXP.  And, games aside, pretty much everything that matters and that anyone bothers with runs on this range of Windows versions.  And, seeing as Windows Vista hasn't exactly set the world afire, I'm betting that Wine might actually have a chance to catch up well enough to be trouble.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and <a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/products/cxmac">CrossOver Mac</a> is based on <a href="http://www.winehq.org">Wine</a>.  And <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2007/10/04/crossover-6-2-supports-team-fortress-2/">CrossOver Mac supports Team Fortress 2</a> <b>right now</b>, <i>without purchase of a Windows license</i>.  Think about that.  So, maybe we shouldn't put games aside.  Really, unless Microsoft can somehow patent the crucial APIs exposed by Windows - if they haven't already - resistance is futile.  There are nerds motiviated and annoyed enough to reverse engineer and assimilate.  I'm not a lawyer, though:  I suppose by the point Wine actually becomes a threat of any sort, nasty things can be sprung.</p>
