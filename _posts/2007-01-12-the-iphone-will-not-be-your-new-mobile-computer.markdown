The last thing you want is to have loaded three apps on your phone and then you go to make a call and it doesn’t work anymore.

I understand what Apple's after here - a mobile environment is a whole lot less palatable when it's got crashes and glitches like the desktop and laptop world.  But, I have been known to [run Linux on my iPod](http://ipodlinux.org/Main_Page), so I like to crack the closed shell on devices that go in my pockets.  Hopefully the iPhone's lockdown is more of a "keep out" sign, rather than a sealed vault.
