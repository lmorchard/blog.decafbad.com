Having skimmed through [this Mozilla newsgroup thread][tt], I'm perturbed anew about the [new Firefox 2.0 misfeature][mff] with [regard to RSS feeds and client-side XSL][nfm].  My original grief was that it cost me a significant bit of pointless debugging time even discovering that it was a brand new gotcha.  But, the "we know what's good for you" sentiment is clear - I feel like posting any newsgroup responses would be just more time wasted.  At least shoving an arbitrary 512 bytes into the feed fixes the bug.  (This seems to compress well: "AAAAAAAAAAAA ... AAAAAAAAAARGH!")

Brilliant: I'll just add that to the body of obscure CSS hacks and bug workarounds that'll someday make me give up web development for raising sheep.  Thanks a million, guys.
