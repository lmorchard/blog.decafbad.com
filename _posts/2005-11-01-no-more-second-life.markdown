title: No more Second Life

Over the past few months or so, I've given [Second Life][sl] about 6 hours of my primary life.    At first, between all the rapidly aging machines I own personally, I didn't have a single one that did the place justice.  Now though, I've got a work machine with enough horsepower to do it up right.

Anyway, although I wouldn't call mine a dedicated attempt at living an alternate life, I think I've seen enough.  Between the awkward controls for navigating space which make me yearn for [Quake 2][q2], and the 90% crud which comes from all ecosystems of "[Consumer Generated Media][cgm]", I don't think I'm going to get it.  

So, like the people who say mostly these same things about podcasting, I think this is a signal that Second Life is not meant for me.  It might obsolete sliced bread for some peopleâ€”but all it does for me is make me want to waste time with Everquest, wash my brain out with [Zork][zork], or script something in a [MOO][lm].  

Of course, I've never *really* bought into the whole Cyberspace / Metaverse thing past recognizing it as a neat device in [William Gibson novels][wg].  I mean, why would you *ever* want to limit [info freako][if] space to a shoddy simulation of meatspace's meager 3 dimensions?
