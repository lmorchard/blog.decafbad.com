Something very cool I just noticed on my MacBook Pro:  There's separate volume settings for headphones versus built-in speakers.  I had the sound muted for external speakers last night.  But, when I plugged my headphones in at work this morning, the volume jumped back to exactly where I'd left it yesterday.  When I realized it happened, I tried alternately plugging and unplugging the headphones, marvelling at the volume icon going back and forth.

Has it always done this?  Is this something new?  Do other laptops do this?  Am I on crack?
