This is a recurring issue for me:  Although I've yet to find anything I actually like overall, I keep thinking I need some tumblelog software that's more inviting for quick quips and quotes.  Sometimes, the affordances of the WordPress posting page make me think I should really write more than a few lines to fill up the space.  So, I don't post anything because I just kind of wander off and never reach the imagined threshold for posting.

This seems oddly related to when I first let myself start writing in a journal with ink instead of pencil - I couldn't stand not being able to erase things and correct them and make them perfect.  Nowadays, one of the first things I do to an Moleskine is ritually tear out the first page and scribble in pen on the next.  Then, I can write on the rest of the pages.  Hmm.  I wonder how I can scribble on a blog?
