Here's a little something I whipped up last week:  <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BlosxomPaginate">BlosxomPaginate</a>.
<br /><br />
I've been using Blosxom and Blagg for my news aggregator lately, just
for a change, and one thing I was really missing was some way to see
entries that fell off the end of the front page.  
<br /><br />
So, I made this.  It
lets me flip back and forth between pages of Blosxom entries, and I
even went so wild as to include full flavour-based template support of
the display of the navigation elements.
