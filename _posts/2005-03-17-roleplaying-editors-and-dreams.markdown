* [VIM][vim] is really feeling like an RPG to me.  Today I just gained a level, maybe two, thanks to [SuperTab][super] and [Tip #173][t173].  Who knows, maybe I'll even be giving up the cursor keys soon and [my original HHKB, sans-inverted-T][hhkb], will make more sense.

* Speaking of RPGs: Last night, I had a hyper-realistic dream that some college roommates, who'd started a [LARP][larp] of their own design back in the mid-90s, had gotten back together to start a new authorized LARP based on World of Warcraft.

  It was $1400 per month to play--which seemed reasonable at the time--and took place 24/7 on the grounds of the [Michigan Renaissance Festival][mrf] in Holly.  Strangely, this was within walking distance of our old townhouse in Royal Oak.  I jumped into the game to play some kind of "wind mage", dressed up like a 3-foot-tall leprechaun.  (Yes, somehow my costume reduced my height by 3 feet or so.)

  There's no real point to this, other than I felt I needed to share its utter depths of nerdity.  Oh, and although I've watched someone play WoW, I don't actually have a machine capable of running it--so I don't even know if it features leprechaun wind mages.
