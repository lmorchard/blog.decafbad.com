This is why I love the web &amp; blogosphere these days.  It's getting just a little harder to get away with bullshit every day.  :)  Threads cross at <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/10/14#When:2:30:09PM">on Dave's site</a> and <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/20798">Metafilter</a>, among other sites, and Microsoft's counter-Switch ad is revealed.
<br /><br />
Man.  And they even used a <a href="http://creative.gettyimages.com/source/search/detail.asp?source=searchResults&amp;imageIndex=10&amp;hdnSync=%22One+Woman+Only%3AOnly+Women%22+and+%22Coffee%3AHot+Drink%22~0%2C12%2C449%2C3%2C15%2C1%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C12287%2C0%2C1%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2Cen-us%2C1%2C%22One+Woman+Only%3AOnly+Women%22+and+%22Coffee%3AHot+Drink%22%2C389%2C257%2C1%2C&amp;hdnCurrPage=4">clip art image</a> for the "real person".  I've not been in the web biz, ad biz, or promotions biz for very long at all, but I've already developed a cynical chuckle for clip art people.  I've either searched through sources myself, or been at the shoulder of a creative director while she or he did the searching.  It doesn't take very long until you can nail it when you see it.
<br /><br />
But clip art in and of itself isn't bad - it's when an attempt is made to pass the clip art over as some kind of candid reality...  that's when a company really shows how smart they think you are.  :)

(Oh, and P.S.:  Can you people <strong>please</strong> stop using those "photographer standing on a stool over a model looking up" posed images?  It really doesn't convey hip, cool, or clever.)
