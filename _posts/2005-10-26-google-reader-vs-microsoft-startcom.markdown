You know how [I dissed Google Reader last month][gr]?  Consider it still dissed.  In fact, checking in again on Microsoft's [start.com][start] makes me think Google has a lot to learn about making a feed aggregator.  I still prefer [my own in-progress aggregator UI][ui], but [start.com][start] has me thinking about ideas to steal.
