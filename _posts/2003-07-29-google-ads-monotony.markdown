Well, I forgot to mention it, but I emailed Google awhile back about their
<a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/geek/adsense_no.html" target="_top">rejecting my site</a> for
Google <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/AdSense?topicparent=Main.FilterData"><b>?</b></a><font color="#0000FF">AdSense</font></span>.  They got back to me and let me in the club, which is
demonstrated by the skyscraper ad to the right.  So far, I seem to be on the
road to earning free hosting for the month, if my clickthroughs keep up,
which is more than I'd hoped for.  I only hope that if everyone's seeing this
kind of performance, that Google makes some money at it and doesn't have to
cancel the program.
<br /><br />
My only complain now is this:  Can I get some ad rotation?  I'm not sure what
you're seeing, but I've been looking at the same 4 ads for backup solutions
since I first plopped the code in.  At first I thought it was neat, since
I'd been talking about backups at the time and the ads seemed an intelligent
complement.  But that story's long since scrolled off the page, and nothing
else interesing has come up since.  Maybe this is by design, but I expect
my clickthroughs to stop pretty soon.
<br /><br />
Now, I have no ambitions to get rich quick via Google.  If they happen to
pay out enough to cover my hosting costs, I'm abso-<a href="http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/07/26/NastyNeologo" target="_top">frickin</a>-loutely
ecstatic.  So, I won't be spending
much time obsessing over search terms and "borrowing" public domain works to
<a href="http://www.associateprograms.com/search/adsense.shtml" target="_top">boosting my <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/AdSense?topicparent=Main.FilterData"><b>?</b></a><font color="#0000FF">AdSense</font></span> revenue</a>,
but it seems like the service could use a little freshening.
<br /><br />
Am I missing something?
<br /><br />
<strong>Update:</strong> Heh, funny thing.  No sooner do I post this and visit the site to
check out how things look, the Google ad appears to have rotated.
Is someone watching?  Heh, heh.
