I like the sun.  Unlike some geeks who fear the Great Lightbulb in the Big Blue / Grey Room, I thoroughly enjoy a sunny day.  Throughout the grey Michigan winters, I'm generally grumpy.  Today's a sunny day, though.  Unfortunately, the place where I'm most productive on the book at the moment is the basement.  Ah well - at least all the drafts are supposed to be done before Spring has sprung.  I'm going to have to figure out how to be productive yet still enjoy the sun.
