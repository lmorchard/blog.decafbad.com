<strong>Update</strong> (7/26): <em>We ended up taking a place in Santa Clara, CA, a minute or two away from Santana Row.  We may be looking again in a year, once we've gotten a sense for the lay of the land.  Thanks for all the wonderful advice, everyone!</em>

So, as <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/06/24/go-west-young-man">I revealed in the previous post</a>, we're moving to California so I can take a job at Yahoo! in Santa Clara.  I'm excited as hell, but I'm also pulling all my hair out and losing sleep.  Luckily, I have a lot of hair and I drink a lot of coffee, but we have a lot of details to work out.  I'm hoping that I might get some advice from you out there, dear readers.  Also, I think I'd like to get the chance to <em>meet</em> you at some point.

We're getting relocation assistance, which will help greatly.  However, it looks like we'll need to do some rush apartment shopping ourselves, and in short order.  We've never done anything like this before, and don't want to end up in a crap place that looked good on the interweb, only to move again in 6 months.

We went on honeymoon to San Francisco, and briefly visited Mountain View in the course of our travels.  We liked the downtown area, had good sushi and bubble tea.  So at the moment, Mountain View is our dart-in-the-map choice for apartment search.  Office is in Santa Clara, so the maps tell me that Sunnyvale and Santa Clara might be good spots too.

Any ideas out there?  Horror stories of places to avoid?  Hints as to what's good and where?
