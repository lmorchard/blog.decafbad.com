<a href="http://interconnected.org/notes/2003/01/Lazy_MacOSX_Weblogging_1.shtml" target="_top">Lazy Mac OS X: Weblog links sidebar</a>: <i>...it's going to be about turning your Mac into a weblogging machine. As easy as the links-and-commentary genre is with all the blogging apps out there, I'm too lazy for the commentary bit, and so I tend to drag-and-drop links to my desktop for later posting -- and then promptly forget about them. Consequently my desktop is a mess, and my blog is stagnating. Bad.</i>
<br /><br />
So... what he made, with <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AppleScript">AppleScript</a>'s Folder Actions, is a magic folder on his desktop.  When links are dropped into the folder, a script is triggered which posts the link to a weblog via <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BloggerAPI">BloggerAPI</a>.  I've tweaked it a bit to ask me for a link title, quote, and a tiny bit of commentary, but it still needs a bit more work.
<br /><br />
I had never heard of Folder Actions before this.  This is very nifty stuff - blogging woven into the OS X desktop itself with <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AppleScript">AppleScript</a>.  Whew.
<br /><br />
What I'd <strong>really</strong> love is to be able to drop a folder onto my dock, and then drop things onto it there.  I'm thinking of a bunch of "bins" on the dock that shuttle files off to different destinations and through various transformations, right there, always in view.
