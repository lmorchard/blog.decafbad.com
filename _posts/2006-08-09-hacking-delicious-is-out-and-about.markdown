<b><i><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0470037857/0xdecafbad01-20/104-2713105-4524705?%5Fencoding=UTF8&camp=1789&link%5Fcode=xm2">I've got a NEW BOOK</a> on <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/deusx/197593569/in/photostream/">the shelves</a>, and I never posted about it!</i></b>

Holy crap - not only have I been a bad blogger, what with the infrequent updates and complete inattention to my web stats, but I'm also a bad author!

Well, perhaps an absent-minded one at worst - because I assure you that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0470037857/0xdecafbad01-20/104-2713105-4524705?%5Fencoding=UTF8&camp=1789&link%5Fcode=xm2">this book</a> is my best yet!  More screenshots, clearer code in more languages, and heaps more hands-on action with <a href="http://del.icio.us">del.icio.us</a> and the constellation of services and mashups surrounding the service.  

In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0470037857/0xdecafbad01-20/104-2713105-4524705?%5Fencoding=UTF8&camp=1789&link%5Fcode=xm2">Hacking del.icio.us</a>, I show you how to tinker around with various ways to more effectively use the service, how to get it better integrated with your site, and how to remix and mashup the data you can access at the site.  I've got some examples in Perl and PHP, as well as a few bits of AJAX madness in HTML and CSS.  There's geotagging and podcasting and even a bit of competitive analysis going on in there.

So, in case it's not yet clear, I've got a new book out and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0470037857/0xdecafbad01-20/104-2713105-4524705?%5Fencoding=UTF8&camp=1789&link%5Fcode=xm2">YOU SHOULD BUY IT!</a>  :)
