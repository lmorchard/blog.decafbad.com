I read about this via <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/javascript/2001/03/23/rollovers.html">Eric Meyer&#8217;s article</a> on the O&#8216;Reilly Network.  I&#8217;m still very much a <span class="caps">CSS</span> neophyte, but it&#8217;s helped me incredibly at work, where I was able to create a site layout with one set of <span class="caps">HTML</span> pages styled by a small library of <span class="caps">CSS</span> files for look &#38; feel.</p>

	<p>Yeah, yeah, that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s for, you say.  But it surprised the hell out of me that I was able to abuse background image properties of containers to create JavaScript-free rollovers, as well as select between completely different image-based layout elements.  This isn&#8217;t pure utopian <span class="caps">CSS</span> that I&#8217;m doing, and most of my position is still with tables, but thanks to blank pixel images atop <span class="caps">CSS</span>-controlled background images, I can do what I think are amazing things.</p>

	<p>Now I just have to break free of the rest of my <span class="caps">HTML</span> crutches, circa 1996.</p>
