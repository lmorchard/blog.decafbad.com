* I wish I could have "soft" desktops/displays on my Mac.  

  That is, I'd like the second (or third or more?) desktop to display to a VNC server while still maintaining the hardware LCD screen as an independent desktop.  Then, I could open a VNC client on my work machine and move some windows over there.  I can do this under Linux with some X11/VNC tomfoolery, so I miss it--though I do understand how and why Quartz != X11.

* [Path Finder][] for Mac OS X reminds me of [Directory Opus for Amiga][do]--at least, it feels like that sort of improvement over the stock system.

* I've noticed that the green maximize button in Tiger windows does the thing I expect more often now.  That is, it makes a window alternately fill the screen (except the dock) or shrink back to the size before I hit the button.
