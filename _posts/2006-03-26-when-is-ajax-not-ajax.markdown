title: When is AJAX not AJAX?

 <p>I started this as a comment over at <a href="http://alex.dojotoolkit.org/?p=551">Alex Russell's entry, "ajaxWrong"</a>, copied here because I felt like it.  He writes:</p>
     <ul>
     <li>
     <span><i>This thing is appropriating the necessarily amorphous terminology of &#8220;Ajax&#8221; for an implementation that is directly at odds with why Ajax is an important technology. A XUL app being billed as &#8220;Ajax&#8221; is just as laughable as a Flex or XAML app suddenly growing the same moniker. That it&#8217;s Mozilla&#8217;s walled-garden language doesn&#8217;t really excuse the gaffe.</i></span>
     </li>
     </ul>
 <p>I thought <a href="http://www.linspire.com/ajaxwrite.php">ajaxWrite</a> was pretty keen when I first tried it - I presumed there must've been a bit of nice trickery to get what is generally called an AJAX app to work like that.  Imagine my disappointed surprise when I realize that they used XUL.  XUL ain't AJAX, no matter how you try to deform and stretch the term.</p>
 <p>AJAX may be a coined term with an acronym of Asynchronous Javascript and XML, but it&#8217;s descriptive of a new wave of web programming practices.</p>
 <p>It&#8217;s not a spec, so you can&#8217;t get away with a literal reading of &#8220;There&#8217;s no HTML in AJAX, so neener!&#8221; It&#8217;s a community concensus term. And, XUL ain&#8217;t a part of it. Hell, read the list from <a href="http://adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php">the original article coining the term</a>:</p>
     <ul>
     <li>
     <span>standards-based presentation using XHTML and CSS;</span>
     </li>
     <li>
     <span>dynamic display and interaction using the Document Object Model;</span>
     </li>
     <li>
     <span>data interchange and manipulation using XML and XSLT;</span>
     </li>
     <li>
     <span>asynchronous data retrieval using XMLHttpRequest;</span>
     </li>
     <li>
     <span>and JavaScript binding everything together.</span>
     </li>
     </ul>
 <p>That&#8217;s what AJAX means to <del>us</del> <ins>me</ins>. If you want it to mean something else and get away with it, you&#8217;re going to have to convince everyone who read that article and ran with that definition.</p>
