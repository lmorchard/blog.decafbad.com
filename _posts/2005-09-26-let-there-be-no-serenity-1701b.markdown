I'm not really sure why this was one of my first thoughts of the day, but here it is:  I'm looking forward to finally seeing [Serenity](http://www.serenitymovie.com), but after listening to the annoyingly spoiler-bleep-happy [Slice of SciFi #024](http://www.sliceofscifi.com/archives/slice_of_sci-fi_024.html) it occurred to me that I really hope they don't blow up the ship in the grand tradition of Star Trek movies.  I doubt that they will, but the temptation is always there to do something *shocking* on the big screen versus the TV screen.
