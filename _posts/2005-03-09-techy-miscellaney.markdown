* I know I've already mentioned it, but man I wish Google had a REST-style API.  The new Yahoo web services are nice, and I've already been enjoying Amazon's web services.

* But, speaking of SOAP: [For the sake of sanity][wsopp], I've mostly been keeping my brain out of the tumult surrounding SOAP and WS-Tech.  I was tracking things a few years ago, but have since wandered away.

  I think I really need to dip into it again, though, because I catch myself regarding this behemoth of technologies as stupid and worthless--a reaction which I've been coming to consider as a red flag on my own ignorance, especially when there are a lot of smart people still seeing value in the same thing.  
  
  Part of it, I suspect, is that I tend not to use rich IDE's on a daily basis, and I'm perfectly happy dealing with REST-style APIs using XPath to extract data and using DOM or string templates to send data.  It seems so easy to me that I wonder just what I'm missing.
  
  I've heard that SOAP and friends brings a lot of joy to people who can just drag-and-drop a schema or self-describing blob into their favorite tool and have all the webbish bits hidden behind native-looking calls and code.  But, for the most part, I just don't get it.

* I don't like working with Microsoft technologies much.  However, it is what we use at work, between legacy ASP 3.0 pages and a smattering of .NET stuff we've been gradually phasing in.  

  One thing I do have to admit is satisfying, though, is using Windows Scripting Host with JScript to pry data out of Word documents and MSSQL tables to build a pile of XML documents--mostly because I didn't think it would work.
