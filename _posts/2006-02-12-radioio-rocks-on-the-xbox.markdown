Radio's dead to me, but I've been putting in a lot of time listening to <a href="http://www.radioio.com/radioiorock.php">radioiorock</a>.  After awhile, though, the playlist repetitions started to get to me after 4-5 hour stints, so I switched over to <a href="http://www.radioio.com/radioio80s.php">radioio80s</a>.  Man, does <a href="http://www.radioio.com">radioio</a> have a single bad station?  Every one I've listened to has some really great selections, B-Sides and "deep cuts" you'd never hear on traditional radio, even back in the day.  Combine this with a living-room resident Xbox equipped with <a href="http://www.xboxmediacenter.com/">Xbox Media Center</a>, and you're living a few years into the future.
