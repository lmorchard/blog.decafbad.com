 <p>On introducing people to blogging, <a href="http://www.scripting.com/2006/02/24.html#bloggingForNewbies">Dave wrote</a>:</p>
     <ul>
     <li>
     <span><i>Then someday, when you're in the shower or lying in bed in the morning and get an idea that you wish you could tell everyone, remember that you have a blog, and go to the computer, and write it up and publish it. That actually feels pretty good, even if you think no one will read it, because you got it off your chest.</i></span>
     </li>
     <li>
     <span><i>Then in a few days Google will probably visit your site and index the post, and then when someone searches for that subject, your page will come up, and maybe you'll pass that idea on to someone who can use it, or meet someone who agrees, or someone who disagrees. And that's blogging, and that's all it is.</i></span>
     </li>
     </ul>
 <p>When I've <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/index.php?s=tuple">written about the blogosphere being like a tuple space</a>, this is basically what I mean - only I use nerdier terms so that I can think about the tools and data structures involved.</p>
