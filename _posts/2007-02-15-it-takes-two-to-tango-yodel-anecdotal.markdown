Sweet merciful crap are [Digg][] fans a scary, groupthink-y bunch.  I work at Yahoo! — so I guess I'm vulnerable to bias — but it seems like the guys on this team just can't get a break.  They open up public suggestion boards to get open feedback on products — something that I think is very cool and clueful.  They took inspiration from Digg and other prior examples of web-based voting, and what do they get for their trouble?  A few hundred lemmings marching to the beat of "OMFG HAX YOU STOLE DIGGS SITE!"

It's not a major news site; it's not like the front page of Yahoo! turned into a Digg clone and they started offering to pay top Digg users.  Seriously - it's just a suggestion board with simple flat comment threads that invites voting to surface good suggestions.  So it's got a big thumbs-up button reminiscent of [Digg][]'s counter badges - they mentioned that it's like [Digg][].  That's inspiration, maybe flattery-level imitation.  But theft?  If I were a thief, would I tell you where I stole my stuff from?
