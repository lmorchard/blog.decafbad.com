I've never been to <a href="http://defcon.org">Defcon</a>, but I've heard stories.  Thus, this exchange I saw on IRC whilst lurking was amusing:
<pre>
[3:12pm] &lt;shiruken&gt; hey, there are 2 rules of Defcon
[3:12pm] &lt;shiruken&gt; 1. Drink lots of fluid
[3:12pm] &lt;shiruken&gt; 2. Wipe your whole laptop and start                                     
over when you get home
</pre>
