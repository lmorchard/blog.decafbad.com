Thanks for bearing with me out there in the blogopshere.  This transition, though
smoother going than I'd thought, is still exposing some rough spots and things
I hadn't thought to check.  Seems my <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> feed hasn't come through quite as intact
as I'd hoped -- and an unexpected bug in the rss10 plugin for <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/Blosxom?topicparent=Main.FilterData"><b>?</b></a><font color="#0000FF">Blosxom</font></span> seems
to have caused some news aggregators to implode.  Apologies all around!
<br /><br />
But, I'm watching, and tweaking, and will be shortly reporting all that I've done
around here to change things.  I'll be cleaning up and releasing my small pile of
blosxom plugins and patches, once I have a bit more time to do so.  In the meantime,
I've got an error log rolling in one window, and I'm keeping an eye on comments and
email.  Hopefully all this will be nice and smooth before the end of the week.
