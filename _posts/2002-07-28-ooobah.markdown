<p>Okay, I do this in what seems like an annual cycle:  Juggle hardware and operating systems around on my home PCs.  The tool I always seem to lose and need again is something to safely allow me to resize and move hard drive partitions, whether they be Linux or Windows.  Has anyone finally made a reliable Open Source tool for this yet?</p>
<p>Generally, I reach for <a href="http://www.partitionmagic.com/">Partition Magic</a> for the job.  It's never failed for me.  But, generally, I need to buy a new copy of it every time I get around to using it again.  I mean, who really needs to repartition a drive more than a few times in a year?  (Okay, you can put your hand down.  You need to get out more.)</p>
<p>Well, this time it looks like I need it again.  I have v6.0, which apparently makes <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP">WinXP</a> choke and drown in its own vomit.  I don't really want to buy Partition Magic again.  Could I just rent your copy for about $10-20 or so?  I've considered wiping <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WinXP">WinXP</a> and re-installing Win98 just because things seemed easier then.  It just seems like this is such a common task when you're screwing with Linux that this would be Done.</p>
<p>Hmm, maybe I'll just pay for the fine product again.  :)  It does work flawlessly for me, even if I only do use it once.</p>
