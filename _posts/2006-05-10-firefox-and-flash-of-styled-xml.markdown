 <p>Here's another random call for support from my blog-friends out there:</p>
 <p>In Firefox, when viewing raw XML, a basic style is applied which does some pretty printing on the XML.  It says something like, "This XML file does not appear to have any style information..."</p>
 <p>Well lately, on my install of Firefox on the PowerBook, that default document tree style appears briefly then reverts to munged text a few seconds later.</p>
 <p>I seem to remember having read about this somewhere, why it happens, and what to do about it.  But, again, like my iptables knowledge, this has dripped out of one of my ears.</p>
 <p>I imagine it's got something to do with an extension or something, but I'm wondering if anyone knows what I'm talking about?  The end goal is that I want my default XML style back.</p>
