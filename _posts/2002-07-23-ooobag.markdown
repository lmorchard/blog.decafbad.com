<p>Okay, so I've seen my first spam via my referrers.  Checked my referrers <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> feed this morning to see the following pages in the list:</p>
<p>http://www.voodoomachine.com/sexenhancer.html<br />
<a href="http://www.voodoomachine.com/linkoftheweek.html<br" target="_top">http://www.voodoomachine.com/linkoftheweek.html<br</a> />
<a href="http://www.voodoomachine.com/druglinks.html<br" target="_top">http://www.voodoomachine.com/druglinks.html<br</a> />
<a href="http://www.voodoomachine.com/awards.html</p>" target="_top">http://www.voodoomachine.com/awards.html</p></a>
<p>Not linking directly to these pages, out of some vague sense of "Don't encourage 'em."  The pages don't really link to me either, of course, they're all just pointers to an ad-ware site for this AMAZING DEVICE that does everything from making sex feel better, helping you study, aiding in sleep...  it even makes DRUGS better!  Wow, this site is so amazingly derivative of the classic <a href="http://www.chemheritage.org/EducationalServices/pharm/asp/asp21a.htm">snake oil pitch</a>, with a touch of the modern and dot-com-days (ie. Works with DRUGS! Click our FAQ link!).  But I can still hear the wheels on the wagon squeaking as it trundles through town.</p>
<p>I'm just trying to imagine by what criteria they picked <i>my</i> site to spam - oh, that's right: there <i>is</i> no criteria.  They don't even know who I am.</p>
<p>On one hand, I'm annoyed that whenever I get back around to working on referrers, I'll need to add a blacklist feature (shared / collaborative blacklists?).  On the other hand, I'm annoyed at the owners of that site, and even more annoyed at the 0.01% or so of their targets who'll BUY NOW.  And then, on another hand still (I have many hands in the blogosphere), I'm amused by the whole thing:  it's almost self-parodying in these post-<a href="http://www.cluetran.com">Cluetrain</a> days.</p>
<p>Oh well, back to work...</p>
