<p>Hmm, looks like I was completely wrong <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000150.phtml">when I wrote</a> that the post-hash bit of referring URLs weren't showing up in my referral logs.  Duh.  I see them right in my "Today's Referrers" block on my site's front page, and a quick SQL query shows me tons of them.  It'll be easier to linkback-enable Radio <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand">UserLand</a> blogs than I thought.</p>
