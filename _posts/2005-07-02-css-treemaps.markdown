Another little test, this time trying to build something like a [Treemap][treemap], using CSS and semantic HTML.

<a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/treemap-history/"><img src="http://www.cs.umd.edu/hcil/treemap-history/treeviz.gif" width="317" height="214" /></a>

The above image is an example of what I'm trying to go for.  Here's a sample of what I've got:

<a href="http://www.decafbad.com/2005/06/tree.html">http://www.decafbad.com/2005/06/tree.html</a>

Two things I can't seem to work around with my understanding of CSS:

1. Is there a way to clear the floats in the unordered lists without using a break?
2. Is there a way to even out the heights and widths of the columns / rows without some Javascript intervention?
