Well, this isn't Podcasting for Cats, but it might be Podcasting for Five-Year-Olds.  Right at this moment, I am caught between giggling and feeling so bad for [IP Relay operators][iprelay].  Abusing these poor saintly people isn't a new hack, but apparently making them call [OpenPodcast.org][openpodcast] and record podcast entries is.  

In the last 20 minutes, I've heard [goofy tongue twisters][op540] (some [from smart fellas][op528]), [many digits of PI][op522], [hot sex scenes in /usr/bin][op517], and [crappy song lyrics][op532].

At least [one person][guy] isn't very happy about it at all.  And, well, I have to agree after listening through a string of a dozen of these as they played in the background.  The calls were amusing, and I hope these messages maybe made an operator's day interesting at least, but umm...  can you guys move on now?

**Update 2004-01-12**:  How meta--[a plea to stop, as an IP Relay message](http://openpodcast.org.nyud.net:8090/media/2005/1/12/openpodcast_611.mp3).
