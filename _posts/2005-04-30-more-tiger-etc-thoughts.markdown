* **Update #1:** <blockquote>Java 1.5 was released early on Friday for 10.4. Just because it wasn't in the box doesn't mean it's not available. :P</blockquote>

  Hooray!  I stand corrected, and a [Java 1.5 update for OS X Tiger is, indeed, available][up].

* You know, episodes of the new Doctor Who seem so short, after having gotten used to story arcs spread across multiple episodes.  Lovely baby-faced aliens, though.

* I was a little afraid that, after installing Tiger, I might not be able to use MS Word.  On the contrary, it seems to be working even <strike>vaster</strike> faster (update: oops, Freudian slip) and better than it was under Panther!

* [New Quicksilver][nq] for Tiger.  Catalog fed by saved spotlight searches, hooray!

* <strike>[No Tiger on Tiger][tig].  Bah.</strike>

* Safari's back to being non-ugly, since I applied [Brent Simmons' suggestion][bss] to hack it in Interface Builder.  Also, Mail is less assy since I found [Cage Fighter][cf].

* I think I'm really going to like `mdfind` and `mdls`, even more so than the GUI support for Spotlight. (Although, you can [do raw queries][rq] in the GUI.)  Poking around, I just noticed this little bit of metadata captured on files downloaded with Safari, found via `mdls`:
    <pre>
kMDItemWhereFroms              = (
    "http://www.otierney.net/files/cagefighter-1.0.dmg", 
    "http://www.otierney.net/cagefighter/"
)
</pre>

    I can't wait until third-party apps like [Path Finder][pf] and [Quicksilver][qs] do a better job with the end-user interface on Spotlight's underpinnings than Apple's first offering.
