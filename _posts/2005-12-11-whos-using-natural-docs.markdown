Having started using [Natural Docs][nd] at work to maintain documentation on parts of a project implemented in ActionScript, JavaScript, Perl, XML, XSLT, and possibly PHP--it seems like a very cool system with an extremely simple and natural syntax applicable to a wide array of source code formats.

Is anyone else out there using this package?  If you were and stopped, how come?  Just curious...
