<p>Getting religion, <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/09/10#When:5:16:47PM">Dave says</a>:<blockquote><i><a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/1969">Nathan Torkington</a> is a humble servant of our lord, Murphy.</i></blockquote>I wonder if Dave, or Nathan, or anyone would mind if I used <a href="http://www.cafepress.com/">CafePress</a> to make available a set of merchandise based on phrases such as "Praise Murphy", "Murphy Willing", "What Would Murphy Do?", "Murphy Saves", "Have you accepted Murphy as your personal savior?"  I might type them all up in a sufficiently imperious gothic font and set up shop.</p>
<p>See, although they might get popular, I wouldn't want to do it for the money.  In fact, I'd give it away to charity.  I just want the merchandise :)</p>
