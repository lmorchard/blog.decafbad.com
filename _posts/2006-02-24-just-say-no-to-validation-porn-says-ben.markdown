There I admitted it. Forgive me, web purists, but this is really nice. ... The whole thing is frictionless - and frictionless tools are what I want this year.</i>"  This is the feeling I got from the OPML Editor when I started trying it out as a blogging tool.</p>
 <p>In another entry, <a href="http://www.benhammersley.com/FCE47259-78BA-4B5E-ABF2-F39B93520C85/Blog/8A127A89-AAD2-4243-8E11-0BDE85AB5394.html">Ben rails against "validation porn"</a> - and then, as if to just tweak the web geek's nose...  the whole text of the article is a solid image, impenetrable to copy-and-paste quotation.  I think I threw up in my mouth a little there, but I get his point.</p>
