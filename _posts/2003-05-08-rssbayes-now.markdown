<blockquote cite="http://matt.griffith.com/weblog/2003/05/08.html#a129">I've never gotten much spam. I closely guard the email addresses I care about. Spamex makes it simple but I did it before without Spamex. My problem is information overload. I'm much more interested in seeing the same thing for <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a>. Instead of blocking stuff I don't want I want it to highlight the stuff I might want.

I've been out of the loop lately because I can't keep up with all of the feeds I would like to monitor. I need help.</blockquote>

Ditto.  Using a Bayesian approach, or some other form of machine learning, as applied
to my aggregator and my viewing patterns is something I've been wanting for awhile now.
I've done some very, very primitive self-monitoring with <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines">AmphetaOutlines</a>, but I'd
like to get back to some machine learning research and build an enhanced
aggregator that learns what makes me click.
