I'm a little annoyed that the [Yahoo! TV refresh last night][tc] broke my bookmarks.  We're luddites who've rejected Digital Cable and On-Screen Guides for the last few years - and Yahoo! TV has been our solution for that.  But, oh well.  I've got [a new TV guide bookmark][tv] now, and all better.

On the other hand, I'm a bit impressed and entertained that the TV guide grid uses an AJAX-ian pagination approach [like this one](http://bluesmoon.blogspot.com/2006/02/rich-accessible-pagination-with.html).

Of course, on the other other hand, it's [pretty slow now][slow].  I found that if I scroll down the the bottom of the page, really really fast, everything gradually loads up.  That seems somewhat suboptimal.
