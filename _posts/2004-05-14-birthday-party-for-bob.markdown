title: Birthday party for Bob!
excerpt: So last night my buddy Bob, aka Macross, aka director / producer / host / tech / janitor of IPM Radio, turned 30 last night. Lots of music, drinks, and monkeys. Can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;ve known this guy for like 14 years. Come take a look at some photos of the party that was broadcast live from his basement.
