<p>Okay, I'm done thinking and writing about <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST">REST</a> for the time being.  I think I understand it, but it doesn't seem to light any fires for me yet.  I'll just stuff it away into my utility belt and keep it in mind in case the need for a <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/REST">REST</a>-headed screwdriver comes up, or until I discover that my RPC usage causes cancer.</p>
<p>What's much more exciting to me at the moment is <a href="http://impressive.net/people/gerald/2000/12/spam-filtering.html">whitelist-based spam filtering</a>, and even more so is <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/12/rubyrdf/util/foafwhite/intro.html">using <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF">RDF</a> to share whitelists</a>.  I really need to look more into this <a href="http://rdfweb.org/">FOAF thing over at rdfweb.org</a>.</p>
<p>One project I've been mulling over is how to replace something like <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=deus_x">my user info page at <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal">LiveJournal</a></a> with something web-wide and decentrallized.  <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF">RDF</a> seems like a lead on that for a shared data format for personal metadata.  I want the friends and friends-of, and especially the interest links that let you pivot on interest phrases to view a list of others who list the same interest phrase.</p>
