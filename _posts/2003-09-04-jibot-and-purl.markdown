It&#8217;s the brains behind purl, the bot serving #perl channels on a few <span class="caps">IRC</span> networks.  Jibot seems to have some funky punctuation-based commands, but purl accepts commands in formulatic english and even picks a few things up from normal channel chatter.  When I look at Kevin Marks&#8217; dump of Jibot&#8217;s brains, I can&#8217;t help but think of the gigantic <a href="http://www.infobot.org/factpacks/">factoid packs</a> available for Infobot.</p>
