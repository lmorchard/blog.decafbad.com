I'm guessing Nova's never seen [Sphere XP][sxp], which is a nifty but not quite useful spherical desktop manager for Windows.  Although, where Nova's talking about being *outside* the sphere and dealing with the surface, Sphere XP is about living *inside* the sphere and spinning around near the center.
