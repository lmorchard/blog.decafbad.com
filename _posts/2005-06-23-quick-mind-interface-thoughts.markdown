I've got a few longer-length blog entries building up, but a few of my semi-usual quick thoughts:

* There's a difference between "ease of use" and "ease of adoption", isn't there?  Think `vi` versus MS Word.  Maybe Doug Engelbart versus Jabob Nielsen?  More to think about this.

* So, in a collision between my speed reading digestion of [Charles Stross' new Accelerando][acc] and remembering [this race between thumb-typing and Morse code][sms]--I've got a notion to explore morse code as a human/computer serial interface for wearables.

  [I'm sure this just *can't* be a new idea][goo], except to me.

  I would like to use two fingers to tap out dots-and-dits on a thigh, or my other palm.  Either that, or I want a Bluetooth version of [this Palm Radio Mini-Paddle][paddle].

  And, I want a buzzer worn somewhere--like a shoulder or a collarbone--so I can use a little [neural plasticity][see] to train myself for morse code input.  And, it would be very nice if I could manage all this with a minimum of attention, say while walking around and not colliding with walls.

  In the end, I want something akin to [Quicksilver][qs], only invisible, fairly attention light, and with me everywhere.  This is just a start, but eventually I want a wearable exocortex like [Manfred's][acc]--the ultimate GTD accessory.
