This seems like the sound of the second shoe hitting the floor.  Although I tried signing up for this as soon as I saw the email, I was already too late to get in on the beta and start playing.  Maybe I'll get in on a second round.
  
EC2 seems a lot like [User Mode Linux][uml] virtual hosting, but it charges <del>by the CPU hour</del> by the hour of uptime instead of month-to-month.  I'll be very interested to see how this shakes out, and what sort of web app architecture it encourages when used in conjunction with S3 - say [AJAX-based queues][aq] for instance? - or if it just gets used as a straight [LAMP][] host in general.
