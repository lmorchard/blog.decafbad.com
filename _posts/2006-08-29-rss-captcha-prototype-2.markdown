I didn't really dislike Kent's original prototype - although I think [it came off that way](http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/08/25/rss-captcha-prototype#comment-34842).  However, with a direct link there, I think there is a definite improvement.  I was also happy to see the linked blog open in a pop-up window - which is something I *usually* despise, but works for this application.  Seems like a neat way to get something CAPTCHA-like, while also promoting traffic to your friends in your blogroll!  The one bad thing would be if I were to decend too many levels deep into reading interesting things and commenting as I chase down post titles.  :)
