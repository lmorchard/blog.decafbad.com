So, sometime around last November, my iBook started having battery 
problems.  It went from 3 hours of life, down to an hour, and finally
down to about 15 minutes' worth of life.  Being lazy and busy, and 
having my iBook mostly at desks near outlets, I put off taking it into
the shop -- I'd just taken it there to replace the hard drive, and I
didn't feel like parting with it again.  Stupid, I know.  Lazy, I know.
<br /><br />
Well, since then, the problem hasn't gotten better, and I was just about 
to get off my ass to do something about it when I see this:
<br /><br />
<a href="http://www.macnn.com/news.php?id=18661" target="_top">MacNN: iBook users experience 10.2.4 battery bug</a>
<br /><br />
So after browsing around forums a bit, I learned <a href="http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=14449&amp;SaveKCWindowURL=http%3A%2F%2Fkbase.info.apple.com%2Fcgi-bin%2FWebObjects%2Fkbase.woa%2Fwa%2FSaveKCToHomePage&amp;searchMode=Expert&amp;kbhost=kbase.info.apple.com&amp;showButton=false&amp;randomValue=100&amp;showSurvey=false&amp;sessionID=anonymous%7C165795247" target="_top">how to reset my Power Management Unit</a>,
did so, and discovered that the battery began to charge again.  I left 
the iBook off and watched the 4 LEDs on the battery gradually light up
over a bit of time while working on my desktop.  Looks like the problem's
solved for now.
<br /><br />
Ugh.  I'm glad, at least, that it wasn't a physically dead battery.
