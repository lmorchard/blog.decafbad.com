This might be a revealing admission:  Listening to the [TWiT][] podcast, and heard a bit where they were grousing about self-serve checkout lanes at stores.  Leo Laporte went so far as to say he wants a human cashier who says hello, and a bagger at the end of the lane.

Personally?  I like the self-serve checkout, even when they're a little buggy.  If I end up having to hold something at a peculiar angle to scan it, I get over that quickly.  In the end, I usually don't have to ask anyone for help, don't have to wait, and generally I get out of the store faster than anyone.

Maybe I'll grow out of it.
