 <p>I was chatting briefly with <a href="http://blogs.opml.org/vacuum/">Ed</a> last night about chatbots and Jabber.  And, apropos my recent enthusiasm for the OPML Editor platform, it's just come back to me:  <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/tcpIm">Frontier and Radio UserLand have support for instant messaging via AIM and Jabber</a>.  I wonder how up-to-date that support is in the OPML Editor?  It's like 2002 all over again.</p>
