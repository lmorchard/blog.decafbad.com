I've been quiet - too quiet.  Work's had me busy again, as has life in general.  But I still have had something in the <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PersonalWebProxy">PersonalWebProxy</a> works:

<div align="center"><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AgentFrank"><img src="http://www.decafbad.com/downloads/frankHeader.gif" border="0" /></a></div>
<br /><br />
It's ugly, but it works and does stuff.  And I was feeling pretentious enough to give it a quick logo and a wiki page.  Enjoy!
