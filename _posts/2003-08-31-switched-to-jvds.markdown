title: Switching to a JVDS server

<br /><br />
It's been one year since I
<a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/ooobfc.html" target="_top">signed up for a <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JohnCompanies">JohnCompanies</a> server</a>,
and though I've had no complaints whatsoever, I've signed up for
a server instance with <a href="http://www.jvds.com/" target="_top">JVDS.com</a> and have moved
just about everything over.
<br /><br />
Why?  Because it's cheaper, and I have less disposable income these
days.  And, well, it seemed like fun to try another virtual server
company, since I've been looking into it so much lately.  The new
server has less capacity than the one I've had at <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JohnCompanies">JohnCompanies</a>, but I
really don't need all that much -- just a roof over my files and a
root password.  Well, I don't really need a root password, but it's
nice to have so that I can tinker around with more things with fewer
questions asked of the management.  (For what it's worth, we're still
using <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JohnCompanies">JohnCompanies</a> servers for hosting at my work.)
<br /><br />
I've almost got this server migration thing down to a science, though,
since I had everything over and up in a few hours.  And that was going
from a <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FreeBSD">FreeBSD</a> system to Debian Linux.  Personally, though I fully
respect <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FreeBSD">FreeBSD</a> and the ports collection, I like Debian and apt-get
so much better.  But who knows, maybe in another year, I'll be moving
again for the hell of it.
<br /><br />
I don't have much in the way of reputation for JVDS, but the management
has been very responsive to requests so far.  In fact, they're using
<a href="http://www.bestpractical.com/rt//" target="_top">RT</a> for their support ticket
management.  Responsiveness has been one of the most impressive aspects
of <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/JohnCompanies">JohnCompanies</a>, since between my personal server and the servers
I use at work, it tends to take less than an hour to get resolution
on any problems I've had.  So far, JVDS has yet to disappoint me as
well.
