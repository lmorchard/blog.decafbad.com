<blockquote cite="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/central/articles/how_it_works.html"><i>Macromedia Central provides a safe environment for developers to deploy occasionally-connected applications. Using Macromedia Central, developers can create an application and give it away for free. Or they can sell it to end users using the Try/Buy framework that is part of Central.                                            </i></blockquote><div class="credit" align="right"><small>Source: <cite><a href="http://www.macromedia.com/devnet/central/articles/how_it_works.html">Macromedia - DevNet : Macromedia Central: How it Works</a></cite></small></div>	<p>I&#8217;ve had <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/geek/flash_xml_magic.html">a bit</a> <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/geek/flash_agg.html">of enthusiasm</a> <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/links/aoehgeibgi.html">for Flash</a> lately.  So, this Macromedia Central thing that&#8217;s been on its way for a little while now looks very interesting.</p>

	<p>But&#8230;  What differentiates it from every other &#8220;widgets on your desktop&#8221; or &#8220;widgets in a little box&#8221; technology that&#8217;s come before?  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=dodots">Remember</a> <a href="http://disobey.com/ghostsites/show_exhibit/dodots">DoDots</a> ?  <span class="caps">CNN</span> called them <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/04/07/dodots.idg/">the web without a browser</a> and there was general gushing here and there about it.  At one point, I was close to being drafted to write a few promotional games using their <span class="caps">SDK</span>, and it seemed nifty enough.  No clients bit, though.  And all that remains of the company on the web are ghost pages and ex-employee photo albums and reunions.  Oh, and I still have a mousepad and a clipboard from the dev kit.</p>

	<p>And then there&#8217;s <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/">Java Web Start</a> and <a href="http://www.konfabulator.com/">Konfabulator</a> .  Have any of these sorts of things really taken off?  I mean, they all have their share of nifty things, but has this idea of a centrallized corral of mini-apps ever paid off?  Flash is yet another cool technology with which to develop these things, but will Central take off?</p>

	<p>I&#8217;m not trying to whiz on anyone&#8217;s Cheerios, since I honestly think these things are nifty, but then again I like widgets with fun buttons to push.</p>
 
<b>Update:</b> Hmm...  Mike Chambers is <a href="http://www.markme.com/mesh/archives/002978.cfm">inviting questions about Central</a>.  Maybe I should wander over there and ask.
