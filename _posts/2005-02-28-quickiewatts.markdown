* [The Back to the Future trilogy][bttf] is, hands down, a work of genius.  And I was overjoyed to watch the whole run on TNT this weekend while I worked on yet another book chapter.

* Why is pasting plain old unformatted text in Microsoft Word considered a "special" paste action?

* And, if Word helpfully extends my selection range one more time, I'll shoot it.  I thought I turned that damn feature off.

* After wrestling for months with libxml2 for FeedReactor, and all the issues I had getting the Python bindings compiled and working on Mac OS X, just so I could play around with XPath and some decently fast XML handling...  I discover that [4Suite][4s] installs like budda on Linux, Windows, and OS X, and seems pretty fast.  I've only used it for XPath so far, but I'm curious to try out what it does for XSLT.
