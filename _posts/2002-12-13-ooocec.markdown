<p>Another little train of thought, whose conclusion will probably be obvious to anyone:</p>
<p>I wonder how hard it would be for me to make a little personal idea processor like <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/" target="_top">Eastgate Tinderbox</a> using <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF">RDF</a>?  Very likely much harder than it was for its author to create the original - I'm by no means smarter than <a href="http://www.markbernstein.org/" target="_top">Mark Bernstein</a>, and he's got years on me in developing tools like <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/" target="_top">Tinderbox</a>.  So why would I even consider rolling my own in this case?  Certainly not the price - for a tool like that, the price is a steal.</p>
<p>No, I think it's because I don't have full access to hack the thing, and it has a few itchy spots for me.  At least, that's the way it looked when I last tried a demo on <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MacOSX">MacOSX</a>.  I wish I could fix them, and rolling my own is the best way I know for that.  And besides, I'm in a real <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF">RDF</a> love fest lately.</p>
<p>But...  Is it really so bad as it is?  Bad enough to try to play catch up with what someone else has already devoted so much to?  Nope.  Bad idea.  Best to promote <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2002/12/12.html#a537">recombinant growth</a>, and rephrase the question:  I wonder how long it would take me to get used to the tool's quirks as I percieve them, make suggestions to the author, and then use the extraordinary hackability <i>already</i> present in the tool to get it soaking in <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF">RDF</a>?</p>
<p>This is a lesson that's taken me awhile to resign to learn, so I figured this would be a good exercise to document it.  And to think, I once spent a year or two trying to re-implement <a href="http://www.zope.org" target="_top">Zope</a>, by myself, mostly in quiet, and with not much to show in the end.</p>
