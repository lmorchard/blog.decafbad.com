Umm...  what is iSync doing?  I didn't know that it had anything to do
with my bookmarks.  Lately I've been using bookmarks more since I started
using <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BookmarkBlogger">BookmarkBlogger</a>.  Nearly every time I try dragging a bookmark into a
toolbar folder, though, I'm rebuffed by this dialog.  What gives?  The bookmarks
don't show up on my PDA, or my calendar.  With what are they being synched?
<br /><br />
I see that <a href="http://birdhouse.org/blog/archives/000810.php" target="_top">Scot Hacker</a> has
discovered the same thing happening to him.  Lots of comments, but still no
answer as to what's up with this.  Hmm.
