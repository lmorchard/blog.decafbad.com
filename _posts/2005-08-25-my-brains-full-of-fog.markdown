Man, starting a new job really takes its toll on my spare brain cycles available at the end of the day.  See, I've had it in my head for the last month or so that I want to do such various things as:

* [Build a new kind of wiki][wiki]
* [Pen a few short stories][stories]
* [Hack up my iPod a bit][ipodlinux]
* Post here more regularly
* [Launch a blog &#38; wiki for my first book][hackingfeeds]
* Maybe write another book

But lately I've been spending the day trying to pin new names to faces, and by night I've been hitting the couch with visions of [Interwoven][iwov] code dancing in my brain.  (Any rude comments I might've recently made about Perl?  They all still stand, but I'll still take Perl over VBScript any day of the week!)

[<img src="http://www.decafbad.com/2005/08/shane.jpeg" align="right" style="border: 0; padding-left: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em" />][shane] Until then, I've got my iPod stuck on Smart Playlist shuffle feeding me a steady diet of [The Pogues][pogues], [Dropkick Murphys][dm], and [Flogging Molly][molly].  Sooner or later this brainfog will clear, and I'll probably be more hyperactively tinkery by the end of it.  Or, at the least, my coworkers will either take away [my desk-resident french press][press] or duct tape my bouncing feet to the floor.

And, as always, I'm in state of constant gratitude and happiness about the girl who lies next to me at night and has [agreed to keep putting up with me][future].

Overall, life's good--busy, but good.
