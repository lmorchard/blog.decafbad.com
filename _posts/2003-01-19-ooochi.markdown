<p>Oh yeah, and further along the lines of <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000387.phtml" target="_top">filesystem sacrilege</a>, my most used OS X apps are:<br />
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~mthole/searchling/" target="_top">Searchling</a><br />
</li>
<li> <a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/" target="_top">LaunchBar</a><br />
</li>
</ul>
Both of these give me lightning fast access with keyboard-shortcut finger twitches to what's on my mind and what I want to do.  I want to find more things like this.</p>
