Is it just me, or is it pretty damn ironic that <i><a href="http://www.ebooks.com/items/item-display.asp?IID=19861">Mac OS X: The Complete Reference</a></i> is available in <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/ebookreader/main.html">Acrobat eBook Reader</a> format, yet the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/ebookreader/main.html">Acrobat eBook Reader</a> is not available for <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MacOSX">MacOSX</a>?
<br /><br />
Yes, I'm bitter.  And stupid.  While I didn't buy the <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MacOSX">MacOSX</a> reference, I <em>did</em> buy a book in eBook Reader format.  Dumb, dumb, dumb.  Can't read it now.  Bastards.  And no returns on eBooks.  Crooks!  Mental note:  Next time remember to buy books whose only compatibilty requirements are sight and literacy.  Unless I decide to learn braille or go for audio books, that is.
