Remember when I wrote that [hacking is my World of Warcraft][hwow]?  Well, lately, World of Warcraft has been my World of Warcraft.  Yes, that's right:  I'm on that slippery slope now.  My best friend and Best Man back in Michigan handed me a copy of the game as a going-away present, ostensibly to help keep in touch.  So, to recouperate from the book writing, the marrying, the moving, and the new job taking - I've been maintaining laziness on the extracurricular hacking front, and WoW has appeared in the vacuum.  I can only hope that I don't next progress into a stage of "Hacking WoW is my Hacking".  Smack me if my name starts appearing [on this site][ui].

Oh and, by the way, if you happen to see a *troll* named **Paytol on Maelstrom**, or a *gnome* named **Fizlfry on Eitrigg** - say hi!
