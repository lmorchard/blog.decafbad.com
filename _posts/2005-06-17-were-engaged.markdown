*The following is the text of an overlay box I've stuck on my site today, which should only appear for you once and only within the next day or two:*
<div style="text-align: center; border: 1px dotted #333; padding: 10px; margin: 10px">
<p> 
Please excuse this interruption in your regularly scheduled surfing.
</p>
<p>
Last night, in front of the Max &amp; Erma's restaurant where we 
had our first date, I dropped to one knee, presented Miss Alexandra  
Asher Arnold with a ring, and asked her to marry me. 
</p> 
<p> 
And, you know what...? 
</p> 

<h2>SHE SAID YES!</h2> 

<p> 
I am now the luckiest nerd in the universe. 
</p> 

<h2>I love you, Alexandra!</h2> 
</div>

<p>
If you'd happen to like to see the box again while I've still got it on the site: 
<br />
<a href="#" onclick="setCookie('shinyshown', 'no')">Click here to clear the shiny cookie.</a>
</p>
