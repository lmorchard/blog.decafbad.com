It's this new blog, I think.  Between the lighter-weight blog template and the faster response times from WordPress in general, it doesn't feel like I'm *Issuing a Decree* or turning a battleship every time I want to fire off a bit of writing to the world.  

I've got a lot of little things I've been *Meaning to Write About*, all pent up in my little pea brain.  So, maybe this is a phase, soon to pass.

I was worried that my sudden renewed verbosity might annoy a few people subscribed to my feeds who'd gotten used to my silence, but I suppose you could see [the previous post](http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/09/27/on-attempted-conversions-via-blog-comment) for an answer to that.
