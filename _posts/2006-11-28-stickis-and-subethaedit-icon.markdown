*Update to the Update:* [The whole issue is corrected now!](http://blog.stickis.com/2006/12/01/subetha-redux/)

*Update:*  In the comments on this entry, I got a [quick response from TheCodingMonkeys](http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/11/28/stickis-and-subethaedit-icon#comment-54166) and [a quick response from Stickis](http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/11/28/stickis-and-subethaedit-icon#comment-54240).  I didn't expect either response, and was happy to see both.  Nothing nefarious to see here, move along.  :)

Checking out [Stickis][st] from a [TechCrunch story][ts], and just curious: 

Is the [SubEthaEdit][see] application icon public domain clip-art, or did the [Stickis][st] crew abscond with and recolor it?

<table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="8" border="1"><tr><th>Stickis:</th><th>SubEthaEdit:</th></tr>
<tr><td><img src="http://stickis.com/skin/img/friend-icon.small.png" />
</td><td><img src="http://www.codingmonkeys.de/subethaedit/images/download-plain.png" /></td></tr></table>

I mean, it's a pretty compelling, attractive, and clever icon for an OS X app that scales up and down pretty well.  I've only ever seen it used for [SEE][see].

(<strike>Oh, and for posterity: Since I've linked directly to each sites' images, the table above may look silly if either site changes.</strike>  ...and the image on Stickis has indeed been changed, so the above table looks silly now!)
