<p>About switching to Mac, <a href="http://torrez.org/archives/000313.php">Torrez says</a> (among other things):<blockquote><i>I haven't loved a brand in a while. The last computer brand I had the hots for was the Commodore Amiga, and that was over 12 years ago. It's nice...but weird.</i></blockquote>My thoughts exactly.  My first home computer was a Commodore 64 (if you're curious, you can see a <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/gallery/lil-kid-me/aao">picture of me</a> getting it for Christmas).  While I was learning to program on the Apple ][e and the Atari 800, my C=64 was home turf after school.  Man, I miss 6502 assembly and screwing with a kernal whose complexities I could mostly encompass in one brain.</p>
<p>And then, when the day came that I could afford a new computer..  I saved my pennies and bought an Amiga 1200 (sorry, no picture).  That lasted me all through college as friends bought and upgraded (and upgraded) PCs.  It wasn't until I was a year or two past graduation, when my poor A1200 was really straining to keep up, that I finally broke down and built a PC.</p>
<p>But now, I feel like I'm back full circle, and the PC's days are numbered in my home.  The Mac is my new Amiga, and Apple my neo-Commodore.  Now I just hope that they don't munge the whole company like Commodore did - I was there on #amiga on EFNet on the day when they announced the first of many buyouts.</p>
<p>I'm not too worried though - Commodore didn't have anyone like Steve Jobs.</p>
