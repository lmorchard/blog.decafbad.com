<p>Looking at the <a href="http://goathack.livejournal.org:8006/doc/hack/r257.html">LiveJournal XML-RPC Protocol Reference</a> again today.  I need to make a <a href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/discuss/msgReader$2198?mode=topic">metaWeblog API</a> gateway to <a href="http://www.livejournal.com">LiveJournal</a>, now that I can supply arbitrary metadata and now include mood and music.  Next stop would be to make a client that can exploit metaWeblog that feels like the LJ client.</p>
