As [noted by Jason Clark](http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/08/15/966#comment-32785), it seems that Bloglines has an issue with titleless posts.  But, posts shouldn't need titles - what do other blogs do with asides?  How does Bloglines handle a blog like <a href="http://scripting.com">Dave Winer's</a>?
