 <p>Just about a year ago, <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2005/06/17/were-engaged">I asked Alexandra to marry me</a>.  Luckily she said "Yes," so today's the day.  Finally here, <a href="http://deus-x.livejournal.com/224670.html">oh god</a>.  And then, the day after tomorrow,  we're off to <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/04/25/a-honeymoon-in-san-francisco">a Honeymoon in San Francisco</a> and surrounding areas.  (And here's a great big <b>thank you</b> for everyone who responded with advice, well wishes, and help for the honeymoon!)</p>
 <p>Also, here's hoping everything goes off without a hitch, and that the CD of ceremony music I burned this morning doesn't skip like the one we tried using in the rehearsal last night.  Otherwise, ritual suicide will be the only option, and this will be my last post to this blog - unless, of course, XML-RPC works from beyond the grave.</p>
