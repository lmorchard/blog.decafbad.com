Hmm.  Time for this blogging clich√©:  Been awhile since last I posted here with any reliable volume.  

But, I'm thinking about whether another revamp of this place might get me going again.  I've also considered making myself whip up an editorial calendar and actually commit myself to writing *something* on interesting topics on a regular basis.  It might be the only way to do it.
