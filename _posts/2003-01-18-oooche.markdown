<blockquote cite="http://homepage.mac.com/dnorman/blog/2003/01/16#TabsInSafari">I've been thinking about the whole "I need tabs in Safari" issue, and have come to realize that no, in fact, I don't need tabs in Safari. ... What I need is a way to manage multiple open web pages in a single window. ... I've done a quick and dirty <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/dnorman/SafariTabs.png">mockup of something</a> that approaches what I'm thinking about. </blockquote><div class="credit" align="right"><small>Source:<cite><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/dnorman/blog/2003/01/16#TabsInSafari">D'Arcy Norman's Weblog</a></cite>.</small></div>
<p>So, yeah, not that anyone needs my US$0.02 added to the cacophony around Safari, but here it is anyway.  Go check out D'Arcy's <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/dnorman/SafariTabs.png">mockup</a>.  I think this is precisely what I want.  I've been keeping myself using Safari since it was released, and I've been disappointed with it very rarely.  Instead of tabs, I've been heavily using the Window menu, wishing for some window navigation shortcuts (ie. prev, next, 0-9 for first ten windows?)</p>
<p>Anyway, I say: tabs can go, but give me a sidebar.</p>
