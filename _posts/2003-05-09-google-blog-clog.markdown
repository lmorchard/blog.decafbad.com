I spend a couple posts talking about a technology with questions or thoughts, then later I go to implement this tech and need specifics and yet 2 or 3 of the top ranks are filled with my annoying blather. Urgh!...</blockquote>

Amen.  More and more, I'm running into myself on Google.  I'll be looking for expert information
on something I'm trying to tinker with, and discover that one of more of the top
search results are me writing about looking for expert information on the thing I'm
trying to tinker with.  Just occasionally do I find myself having actually provided
the information that I'm currently seeking.
<br /><br />
I mean, it's not a gigantic shocker-- my interests are relatively stable over
time, and I circle back to things after long periods of time, so this is to
be expected I suppose.  But I'm starting to feel like I'm in a bad time travel
movie.
