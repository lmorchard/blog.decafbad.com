Not sure if this is a new trend, but I've gotten a few in-system messages on [last.fm][fm] from artists whose music I've listened to and gotten included in my charts / history.  The latest of these was from [Nell James][nj], whose original music and Yes covers I've [thoroughly enjoyed][en].  So, contrary to the bulk of marketing thrown at me, I actually welcomed the news that she's got an album out and thanked her for the heads up.  When it works like this, a personal message gladly received, "marketing" seems like a dirty word to apply.
