* Earworm snippet of the moment, "[Don't let the bastards grind you down.][u2]"

* [PubSub][ps] has a pretty cool fade-out-on-focus overlay on their front-page search textarea.

* [OmniWeb][ow] has a pretty cool form editor for textareas, invokable via a button at the top of the textarea's scroll button.  (And, yeah, I'm [bouncing][bounce] to OmniWeb right now, for some variety.)

* I really need to get some free time cleared up soon and attend to a refresh for this place.  My Movable Type install and everything else has been slowly rotting and it's starting to smell.  

  And, I really need to get some comment-spam plugins in place, which fell off my radar when I installed MT v3.  I've been neglecting my duties in approving comments, thus defeating their purpose in sparking conversation when I'm not around, not to mention showing some appreciation for all the valuable pointers and things people say.  (*Thank you for your comments, even if I don't get around to making them appear promptly!*)
  
  And hell, while I'm at it, I might even move over to WordPress.  
  
* Speaking of comments... [Pete commented][pete] on my SOAP musings thusly:

  > Sometimes I wonder if it&#8217;s just the hacker mentality or instant gratification, but whenever I dig into SOAP, I get bored with it and want to move on. When I dig into a RESTful API like Yahoo! has, it&#8217;s so darn quick and easy to kick out an idea that it gets done before I ever get a chance to be bored with it. In fact, I get done, and am still excited about it!

  I'm wondering if this isn't it in a nutshell for me and my taste for REST over SOAP.
