<cite>Russell Beattie</cite> <a href="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/index.jsp?date=20021227#160210" target="_top">writes</a>:<blockquote><i> The idea in my mind is for a project that would be a universal personal proxy (UPP) that sits between you and the internet. It would be a web proxy, email filter, spam cop, a place for agents and schedule tasks to run and more. It would be responsible for both receiving and sending of information - as web pages, emails, web services requests, ftp file postings, etc. In the middle it would do analysis like for Spam or <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> autodiscovery, intelligent bookmark history, etc. ...  This sort of app would be for people like myself who spend an innordinate amount of time on the internet.</i></blockquote>Precisely.  Exactly.  Even down to the combination of P2P and desktop-to-server mix he writes about.  I think we're starting to ride a meme here.  This is what I want from a <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PersonalWebProxy">PersonalWebProxy</a>.  I've been trying to think of a better name for this class of app - it's more than a literal web proxy.  I want an agent and an assistant - something that sits shotgun with me while I putter around and can help me study what I do and see.  I want something that can eventually do things in my name for me, if I allow it.  I want basically all the things Russell wants, along with everything agents do for the characters in David Brin's <i>Earth</i>.
<br /><br />
So.  How to <strong>do</strong> this?  I think I need to spend some more time fleshing out a spec before I do much more in terms of putting gadgets together.  Need to reign in the fantasy, lay out some feasible first revision features, and start.  I want it all, but I want to start out with something hackable, useful, and inviting for collaboration.
<br /><br />
Still probably too early to be thinking about implementation language, but I have been experimenting and expect some of these things to become the base for my development.  My ideas on choices have become less clear-cut now.  When last <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000362.phtml" target="_top">I wrote</a> about this topic, and languages, <a href="http://www.ulaluma.com/pyx" target="_top">Donovan Preston</a> left a comment enlightening me with regards to my Python/Twisted vs Java/Threads consideration.  In fact, threads are available in the Python/Twisted environment as well.  So, now I'm back to thinking about things like free library availability, environment maturity, possible collaborators, and my own comfort level in each.
<br /><br />
Bah.  At this point, I think I know all I need to know about what various environment choices can do in order to come up with a set of features that can be reasonably implemented in either or any environment.  Need to solidify this wishlist into a task list and design and get going.
