So, [since Firefox 1.5 has hit the wires][ff], I'm giving it a shot again.  I just can't stay put on web browsers, can I?  

I've been poking at the last few pre-release versions of Firefox and have been pleasantly surprised:  It doesn't seem to be the CPU hog it once was for me, and someone built a [Tab Sidebar extension][ts] which comes pretty close to the tab drawer I love in Omniweb.

Now, I just have to see if I can figure out a way to force the sidebar narrower than the 150px or so it insist upon as a minimum width—I really want 25px-50px thumbs in my tab thumbs.
