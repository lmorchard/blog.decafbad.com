*Posting this now, but I don't feel like it's finished.*

Some things that make me feel like I might be getting old:

* Collapsing into bed at 2AM on a nightly basis during the week no longer appeals to me.
* I wear wrist braces and a CPAP mask to sleep at night.
* My hair and goatee are starting to go grey.
* I'm gaining weight and really need to exercise.

Some things that make me feel like I might be growing up:

* Getting up before 6AM is starting to seem like a good idea, regardless of my relationship to mornings.  
* The new car I got after I totaled my old one is cleaner inside than any vehicle I've ever owned.  This is a big step: I once had a car with plants growing out of the carpet on the passenger side.
* I quit smoking cold turkey a few years ago and, with the exception of one half-cigarette after losing a job (which only made things worse), I haven't started or been seriously tempted to start again.
* I don't eat out for breakfast, lunch, and dinner every day anymore.  I've even been known to bring leftovers to work for lunch.  This is a new thing for me.
* I haven't eaten at McDonald's in about 5 years, although I am still a sucker for Taco Bell occasionally.
* These days I drink water, coffee, tea, and milk--and I haven't had much more than a sip of Coke or some other sugar bomb in years.
* I'm finally getting my hypoglycemic blood sugar swings under some semblance of control and maintaining mental coherence pretty much all day.
* I'm actually starting to do things I've always though of as Life Goals.  (Like, writing a book.)
