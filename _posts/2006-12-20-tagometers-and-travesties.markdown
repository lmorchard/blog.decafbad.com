You know you've truly arrived in Silicon Valley when [the darling new feature you just helped launch][ta] on [a Web 2.0 site][del] gets shredded in [a rant by Dave Winer][dw].  :)  

My day, having started with me in a foul mood, has been made.  Pre-launch, the tooth marks in my tongue have gotten deep as I watch the [comments][com] pile up.  It's exciting to have so many people debating something you've made.  (Update:  Seriously.  I'm in a better mood now.  It's made me laugh.)

Actually, it wasn't the [feature itself][ta] that got shredded, so much as the [new JSON data feed][jf] revealed before the [intended star of the show][ta] made it on-stage, by way of [a screencast preview on Y!DN by Matt McAlister][mm] and [an amplification by Niall Kennedy][nk].  

The feed itself is mainly intended to power our new [Tagometer][ta2] page widget include thingy.  Beyond that, leaving the feed decoupled from the include itself made sense to me, both for our own flexibility's sake and as a nod toward our mashup friends in the blogosphere and lazyweb.

You see, I like JSON.  It was convenient in this use case of creating a remote blog widget fed by cross-domain sourced data.  I, personally, didn't even have to [reinvent anything][dw] that wasn't already implemented in [assorted off-the-web tools][json].  JSON worked for this purpose - it might not work for your purpose.  <strike>If it doesn't, please accept my insincere apology, but yours wasn't my primary goal.  Attempts to string me up for this travesty will be met with giggles and pointing.</strike>  (Update:  I realize I'm not the to-be-strung-up party responsible for the JSON travesty - I just couldn't resist being a smart ass for its own sake.  I really do giggle and point a lot.  My *actual* apologies for that.)

It's funny, laugh.

[JSON URL feed][jf] is not really an API.  [JSON URL feed][jf] is not a bold declaration of side-taking in the grand war of web service specifications.  Do not base business models on [JSON URL feed][jf].  Caution: [JSON URL feed][jf] may suddenly accelerate to dangerous speeds or stop altogether.  [JSON URL feed][jf] contains a liquid core, which, if exposed due to rupture, should not be touched, inhaled, or looked at.  Ingredients of [JSON URL feed][jf] include an unknown glowing substance which fell to Earth, presumably from outer space.  If [JSON URL feed][jf] begins to smoke, get away immediately. Seek shelter and cover head.  

Do not taunt [JSON URL feed][jf].
