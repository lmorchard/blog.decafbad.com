* Morning is not my friend--and I have struggled with this for so long that I have become all but convinced that I'm part of an evolutionary branch of humanity who stayed up late and kept the fire going while the day shift slept.  Sometimes I think I should try making a career out of doing long-distance freelance work for another time zone whose morning starts several hours later than my own.

* I knew that my iPod had a Notes menu fed from the Notes folder, but I didn't know [that it did inter-note hyperlinks][podlinks].  This rocks my book-authoring socks.

* The lack of a [decent Python interpreter for PalmOS][palmpy] is making me want to [learn Lisp][lispme] again.

* Taking screenshots of an iPod sucks.  This does not rock my book-authoring socks.

* Have I mentioned lately that I hate, *hate*, **hate** character encoding issues on the web?   Mmm, ISO-8859-1 characters pasted into a file claiming to be UTF-8...

* MJD's [_Higher Order Perl_][hop] is out! And I also just noticed Randal's [_Perls of Wisdom_][perls]  Man, it's been a long, long time since I was last excited by Perl--and I used to *live* in it.
