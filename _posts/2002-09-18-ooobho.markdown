title: TWiki + Automatic MT-Search = WeblogWithWiki
wordpress_url: http://www.decafbad.com/blog/?p=256
---
<p>I just discovered and integrated <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTSearch">MTSearch</a> into <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/DecafbadWiki">DecafbadWiki</a> by using a TWiki include to pull in a search constructed with the current wiki topic's name.  It took all of 15 minutes, including the time to login and download <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTSearch">MTSearch</a> to my server.  This, along with my <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin">MTXmlRpcFilterPlugin</a>, completes a simple but effective automatic loop between blog and wiki.  I think this pretty much satisfies my original goal of a <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/WeblogWithWiki">WeblogWithWiki</a>.  </p>
<p>That was <strong>so</strong> much easier than I'd thought it would be.  One of those things I kept thinking "Wouldn't it be nice if?" but kept procrastinating because I thought it'd be so much harder.</p>
<p>I'm still amazed that <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ItJustWorks">ItJustWorks</a>.</p>
