So, as I'm working to recover all the old tools I knew and loved on my
iBook, I see this on the
<a href="http://web.ics.purdue.edu/~mthole/searchling/" target="_top">Searchling home page</a>:
<blockquote><i>Work on Searchling has ceased to focus on its successor
-- iSeek.</i></blockquote>
...and there are no downloads for searchling available, neither binary
nor source.  Harumph!  
<br /><br />
And the screenshots of iSeek don't please me much -- I see a search
field wodged into the menu bar in place of the nice, slick ghostly
search field that would materialize with a quick Cmd-Space or a click
of the magnifying glass.  Gagh.  My menu bar's already crowded enough
with <strong>menu entries</strong> on this 12" screen as it is.
<br /><br />
But, if I'm completely wrong, and there ends up being a feature to
make iSeek work and feel just like my old friend the Searchling...
well, then I say congratulations to its author for cobbling together a
saleable lil widget, and I'll be waiting impatiently for its release.
:)
