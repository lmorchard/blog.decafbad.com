I'm tired of filling out profiles, and I'm tired of building up networks of others' profiles online.  Everyone needs to adopt something like <strike>[FOAF](http://www.foaf-project.org/)</strike> [hCard][] and [XFN][] (updated per suggestion from [Kevin Marks][]), and be done with it.  The networks should be semi-automated, or at least suggested, by detecting who I know from other places as they hop on another bandwagon with me.  (The separations between implicit groups bounded by the particular service are as important as explicitly defined groups.)

[LiveJournal][] was my first experience with much self-disclosure online, into which I dove with much enthusiasm.  But since then, I just haven't felt the need to replicate self-disclosure anywhere else but on my own site.  [Orkut][], [Rize][], [LinkedIn][], [MySpace][], [Vox][], [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us), [last.fm](http://last.fm), [flickr](http://flickr.com), 43 {[Things][]|[People][]|[Places][]} -- these are sites in which I've had some passing or lasting interest in the last few years, but I wish I could just point them all at a single source for learning about *me*.  It all needs to be turned inside out, and lock-ins removed.

Centrallized identity and social network management for distributed service providers is what I want.  I'm sure there's already a movement afoot, and I've just not reached that spot in my to-read list.
