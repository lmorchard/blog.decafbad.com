So here's where a review class of posts would come in handy, because I've *really* been digging on [Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex][gits].  The opening theme, "Inner Universe", really snares me in and the post-human story-lines have been great.  And I just recently realized that Yoko Kanno did the music for the show--which has all been brilliant, just like what she did for [Cowboy Bebop][cowboy].
