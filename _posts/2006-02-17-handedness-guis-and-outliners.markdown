 <p>Reading <a href="http://dannyayers.com/archives/2006/02/15/treehandedness/">Danny's bit about Treehandedness</a> reminds me that I've been meaning to mention something about outline UI for awhile now.  And that something is this:  Why are the disclosure triangles on the left, yet the scroll bar is on the right?  I think it's left-to-right reading and the visual semantics of a bullet point colliding with the general right-handedness of most GUIs.  If you're a lefty, you may have a different take on this.  But at any rate, if you take a peek at <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog_attachments/miniagg-1.jpg">my latest in aggregator UI design</a>, such as it is, you'll see that I've opted for sticking the triangles on <i>both</i> sides and clustered the per-item controls over by the scroll bar on the right.  You shouldn't need to bounce your mouse from side to side on the screen to interact with this stuff.</p>
