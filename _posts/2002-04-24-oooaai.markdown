<p>Playing with a range of news aggregators once more, since <a href="http://radio.userland.com">Radio <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand">UserLand</a></a> is making me itchy again.  Pretty much the only ones I really like are Radio, <a href="http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk">AmphetaDesk</a>, and sometimes <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/~rael/lang/python/peerkat/">Peerkat</a>.</p>
<p>For the last week or so I've been mostly alternating between Radio and <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk">AmphetaDesk</a>.  The difference in aggregation styles is interesting:  While Radio slices and dices and aggregates feeds by items and serves them up to me in an interwoven chronological order, <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk">AmphetaDesk</a> serves my feeds up to me whole and in order of feed modification.  I'm not sure which I like more now.</p>
<p>I like Radio's style, because I see what's new and only what's new.  Usually.  But, I like <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk">AmphetaDesk</a>'s style because I see everything, and have realized that I miss things with the rush of new items from all my feeds.  For instance, if someone posts something once per day, I'll likely miss it with Radio unless I check every hour.  But, with <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk">AmphetaDesk</a>, I get to see what's new with every <i>person</i> or <i>source</i> whenever I check, and I only miss items if that feed has scrolled them off.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.burningbird.net/weblog/2002_03_01_burningbird_archive.php#75003900">Shelley Powers of burningbird.net</a> <a href="http://p2psmoke.org/distributed/rss.htm">wrote a bit about</a> the context destroying nature that <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> and aggregators have on weblogs.  I agree with her somewhat, in that pulling the words out of the surrounding context of the blog and its presentation and community has an altering effect, I wouldn't say that it destroys the weblog.</p>
<p>For me, when I see something on my news aggregator, it's as if I'm overhearing it from another room.  I don't get the whole context or see who else is listening or responding, but I hear the gist of something.  And, when subscribed to 100+ <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> feeds, it's like I'm floating in this Nth dimensional space where I can overhear voices from hundreds of rooms without being overwhelmed.  When something triggers some of my mental filters and watchwords, I click the link and delve deeper.</p>
<p>There's no way, without an aggregator, that I'd be able to track 100+ people and news sources in a day.  But, because I can, I've been able to learn and discover things and hear voices I never would have before.</p>
<p>But, I think the way <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk">AmphetaDesk</a> merges these sources might be a nicer alternative.  By not chopping up the feeds, some intra-item context is maintained at least, so I can see developing trains of thought.</p>
<p>Okay, must go back to work now.</p>
