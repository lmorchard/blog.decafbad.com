*Update:* Yeah - I sent out a request for comments after breaking my comments.  Ugh.  Thanks if you tried commenting, and I hope you might try again.  If not, thanks for stopping by anyway!

So, I've been basically hacking on nothing after work for quite some time now.  I've had a few false starts, but have been finding it hard to get motivated to move on anything.  There are a few things I've started, though, which might be worth returning to and finishing.  If I were to do that - or start something new - which of these do *you* think might be worth my time?

* [FeedMagick2](http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/FeedMagick2/) - web command-line toolkit for munging and filtering feeds, written in PHP 5
* [XoxoOutliner](http://decafbad.com/svn/trunk/XoxoOutliner/) - a browser-based outliner with a REST API, written in PHP 5
* Learn [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/) or [Pylons](http://pylonshq.com/), do social networky stuff and explore OpenID and OAuth?
* Explore [CodeIgniter](http://codeigniter.com/) or [Kohana](http://kohanaphp.com/home.html) further, do social networky stuff that can ideally be installed alongside WordPress and PHP 5?
* Something else?  [OpenSocial](http://code.google.com/apis/opensocial/)?  Keep hacking on my Centro's Blazer browser and do something silly and Web 2.0?
* Level [my troll](http://armory.worldofwarcraft.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Maelstrom&n=Paytol) to 70 and work on getting sweet PvP gear?
