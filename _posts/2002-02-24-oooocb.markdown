Thinking that simple is better here, so I tossed out the big vertical sidebar navigation for a much simpler nav bar at the bottom.  Also playing around with putting wiki changes in the sidebar.
<br /><br />
Any thoughts?  I think I'll stop twiddling with that for now and play around with getting a few more things released.

<i>Okay, maybe one more tweak.  This is not exactly like <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/OutOfBox">out-of-box</a> Movable Type, but hopefully not annoying.</i>
