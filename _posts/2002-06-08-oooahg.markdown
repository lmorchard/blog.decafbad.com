<p><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/deus_x/cocoa-dev/ampheta-on-x.jpg" target="_new"><img hspace="6" vspace="6" src="http://www.decafbad.com/mt-images/ampheta-on-x-sm.jpg" border="0" align="right"></a>This past week, I've been playing with the new <a href="http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk">AmphetaDesk</a> checked out <a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=21649">from CVS</a>.  <a href="http://www.disobey.com/about/morbus.shtml">Morbus Iff</a> gets closer to a release, and I threw together a <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/deus_x/cocoa-dev/ampheta-on-x.jpg" target="_new">Cocoa wrapper</a> and <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/deus_x/cocoa-dev/amphy-outline-skin.jpg" target="_new">outline skin</a> for Ampheta.</p>
<p>I've been bouncing between <a href="http://radio.userland.com">Radio</a>, <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/~rael/lang/perl/blagg/">blagg</a>, and <a href="http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk">AmphetaDesk</a> for my reading this week, and I'm leaning more and more toward Ampheta.  Radio's a powerhouse giant, blagg is a tiny gem, but <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk">AmphetaDesk</a> is starting to look just right.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/mt-images/amphy-outline-skin.jpg" target="_new"><img  hspace="6" vspace="6" src="http://www.decafbad.com/mt-images/amphy-outline-skin-sm.jpg" border="0" align="left"></a>Especially after I hacked together an outline-style template for it today.  You can grab a copy of it over here: <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/gems/amphy-outline-skin.tar.gz">amphy-outline-skin.tar.gz</a></p>
<p>Back up your <code>AmphetaDesk/templates/default</code> directory and replace it with the one in my tarball.  It's still nasty, probably horribly buggy and inelegant, and seems to vaguely work under Mozilla 1.0 and IE 6.0.  But amongst the skin's features are these things:<ul><li>All channels, items of channels, and descriptions of items are arranged in a tree of expandable/collapsible branches.</li><li>Links are provided to expand/collapse all channels, and all items in a given channel.</li><li>If more than 10 items appear in a channel, the rest are hidden below a collapsed branch, but still available.</li><li>From newest item to oldest, the font changes from large and bold to small and normal.</li></ul>Check it out, let me know what you think.  It's based on <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0104487/gems/activeRenderer/outliner.txt">Marc Barrot's activeRenderer code</a>, and inspired by <a href="http://www.pipetree.com/qmacro/2002/Jun/2#slamwedge">DJ Adams' application to blagg</a> of the outline presentation.</p>
