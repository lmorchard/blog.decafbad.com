Gawd, I hope so.  I&#8217;m stringing too many slash-inated names together these days.  :)</p>

	<p>I voted for Feedcast, since it seems to be the least &#8220;clever&#8221; name yet identifies the concept.  It could be used in corp-speak and geek-speak without too much wincing.  And it&#8217;s not an acronym.  All good things, in my short span of experience.</p>
