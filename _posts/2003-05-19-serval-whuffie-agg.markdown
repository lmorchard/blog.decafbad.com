title: You've Got Your Whuffie in My Aggregator!

<blockquote cite="http://john.beimler.org/serval_aggregator_first_post.html">I've given the aggregator a concept of whuffie. I can give any item that has been aggregated a thumbs up or thumbs down, increasing or decreasing the item and site's wuffie. I sort the sites out as I display them by their whuffie. It is a simplistic way of keeping the sites I'm interested in at the top of the list. I'd like to wire in a Bayesian classifier too, and see if that helps me get the items I like to the top.</blockquote>

<div class="excerpt">Yay, an aggregator with whuffie-tech!  This is very similar to what I was doing with
<a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlines">AmphetaOutlines</a> for <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaDesk">AmphetaDesk</a> - when I click on an item from a channel, I increment
a counter for that channel.  And, when I sort channels for display, I use that count as
a factor in the sort.</div>
<br /><br />
And, of course, <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/rssbayes_now.html" target="_top">I want to use Bayesian filtering to see what I <strong>do</strong> want.</a>
<br /><br />
What would really be whuffie-riffic about aggregators that support this kind of
thumbs-up/down tracking, would be to have some P2P sharing of these decisions
to come up with something actually more like whuffie.  That is, I would like
to see how much right-handed whuffie some item has gotten, and possibly
bubblesort up or visually tag items I've yet to read based on that whuffie.
Right-handed whuffie being, of course, the accumulation of whuffie an item
has be given by authors to whom I've given lots of whuffie.
