<p>Along with tweaking my <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> template today, I've been tweaking <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/downloads/lmo-foaf.rdf">my <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FOAF">FOAF</a> file</a> after perusing the <a href="http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/">FOAF vocabulary</a> again and having spied on the <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FOAF">FOAF</a> files belonging to some of the bloggers in my neighborhood.  </p>
<p>Trying not to fall prey to simple cut-and-paste copying, and trying to keep in mind the underlying <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF">RDF</a> model as I push things around.  I've been browsing things with <a href="http://brownsauce.sourceforge.net">BrownSauce</a>, but I have to keep reminding myself not to fall for the "looks okay in the browser, must be okay" fallacies that plague the entire HTML universe.  Just because it seems to render in <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/BrownSauce?topicparent=Main.FilterData"><b>?</b></a><font color="#0000FF">BrownSauce</font></span> doesn't mean it's okay, and just because it might not look okay doesn't mean that it isn't.</p>
<p>Must learn the model and the vocabulary.  Repeat this 100 times.</p>
<p>Whew.  Anyway, the more that I look at it, the more that I'm thinking that <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FOAF">FOAF</a> is the perfect <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournalFriendsReplacement">LiveJournalFriendsReplacement</a> format.  I can't believe I hadn't seen this before and gone completely gonzo over <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FOAF">FOAF</a> already.  </p>
<p>I think I'm grasping <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF">RDF</a> and the <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FOAF">FOAF</a> vocabulary, so I don't think it would be a herculean task to build something similar to the user info editing pages over at <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal">LiveJournal</a>, and to build a <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FOAF">FOAF</a> display page <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/userinfo.bml?user=deus_x">like my user info page</a> on <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal">LiveJournal</a>.  Perfect.</p>
<p>In fact, I wonder if I might not be able to work out a conversion between the two, maybe create a supplemental vocabulary to supply details that <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal">LiveJournal</a> does yet <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/FOAF">FOAF</a> doesn't.  (ie. bio, IM accounts, birthday, blogrolls, etc.)</p>
<p>More study to come...</p>
