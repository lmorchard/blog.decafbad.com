Huh.  Generally, I scoff at the idea of hand-holding widgets for blogs.  But, having peeked at the new [WordPress Widgets](http://automattic.com/code/widgets/), I actually get the sense that they will actually make tweaking things for this blog easier and more theme-agnostic.  I can roll my own widgets, and not need to rejigger the main theme and associated templates every time I drop in an update.  Swanky.
