And, when companies I worked for paid for travel as freely as for paper clips, I made rounds at a few conferences.  I was lucky enough to meet a few other #perl regulars.  I doubt most of them remember me since they&#8216;re a fairly close-nit group, and I&#8217;d only made the one appearance, despite constantly swearing I&#8217;d make it to a <a href="http://www.yapc.org/America/"><span class="caps">YAPC</span></a> at some point.  But I always thought it was cool as hell to actually have had a beer at the same table in Boston with authors of some of my favorite O&#8216;Reilly perl books.</p>

	<p>But, I got busy, stopped hanging out in <span class="caps">IRC</span> so much, and also decided that I needed to expand my horizons and stop being so narrowly focused on one language.  I got into Java, Python, shell scripting, and <span class="caps">PHP</span>.  I started this weblog, and I tried to purposefully keep away from Perl.  Of course, I can&#8217;t stay away, because Perl code comes out of my fingertips as naturally as breathing when a problem presents itself for solution.</p>

	<p>And then there&#8217;s community.  I&#8217;ve yet to find a Java community as quirky and entertaining as that surrounding Perl.  Thus, Java bores me.  I use it, but it&#8217;s strictly business, mostly.</p>

	<p>When what you&#8216;re doing <strong>is</strong> strictly business, I guess that&#8217;s desirable.  But when you eat, sleep, and breathe this stuff, having a group of people constantly doing clever things and being odd certainly makes it more rewarding.  It&#8217;s predictability versus creativity.  To get the job done, you want solid and dependable tools.  To have fun, you want some challenge and unexpected results.</p>

	<p>To me, Perl and its community offers both.  I think Python might, also, but I&#8217;m not as familiar there.  Java and other technologies are mostly business.  Maybe this also crosses over into the difference between IT people and CS people, and whether you&#8216;re here to work or here to play and get paid.</p>

	<p>Hmm.</p>
