You know, <a href="http://scuttle.org">Scuttle</a> is a surprisngly full-featured PHP clone of del.icio.us.  I say surprisingly because I first downloaded the latest release version from November, played a bit, and was just a <i>bit</i> impressed.  Then, I downloaded the CVS version and installed that and got a lot more excited.  I'm considering installing a version of it on my server and mirroring my bookmarks to it.  Still checking out the other clones I've downloaded and installed, though.
