<p>Oh well, guess there's only one thing for me to do: quit whining and write the code...</i></blockquote>So I'm the 0xDECAFBAD guy now, eh?  Hee-hee.</p>
<p>Well, I haven't gotten around to writing the proxy yet, so <i>you</i> can beat <i>me</i> to <i>that</i> still. :)  I've had a metric ton of good and sometimes new ideas throughout my relatively short life, but I have a habit of not getting very many of them done.  <i>That's</i> where it counts, not necessarily in the novelty of the idea.</p>
<p>I mean...  just look at Microsoft.</p>
