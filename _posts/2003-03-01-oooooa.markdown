Not much to see here yet, but I've burnt down my old weblog and
replaced it with this.  Planning to start out simple and gradually
re-introduce features from the previous incarnation very slowly and
carefully.  I've enjoyed many of the toys I've piled on top of this
blog, but its time to revise and simplify.
<br /><br />
I've also been thinking of expanding the focus around here a bit: Up
until now, this place has just been the home of my nerdy brane dumps.
But, I'd like to entertain the notion of opening the place up to more
of my writing.  Assuming, that is, that I can reacquaint myself with
certain muses and notions of free time and management thereof.
<br /><br />
I really appreciate every reader of this site, though, so I've tried
to minimize the impact of changes.  Broken links are bad.  Links to
individual blog entries from the old site should redirect themselves
to their newly converted counterparts.  And, no matter what new trash
I start publishing here, the old <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> feed will continue to show mostly
nerdy brane dumps.  Should you want to follow any expanded content I
start to spew here, you'll need to update your links and
subscriptions.  It's up to you.
<br /><br />
Anyway, thanks for reading, bear with me, and wish me luck.
