<b>Update:</b> <i>A nice mention and ensuing discussion of this has appeared with <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/view/816">this article at Lambda the Ultimate</a>.  I've killed trackback here due to spam, so I'm tossing this in manually.</i>

It's been awhile since I really sat down and tried knocking something out in the browser with JavaScript / DHTML.  There was that [Greasemonkey thing][gm] I did a little while ago, but that's not quite the same.

So, I suddenly got an urge today to try making a mindmap-ish, boxes-and-lines chart out of some simple nested HTML lists using CSS and unobtrusive JavaScript.  I didn't get all that far toward the original goal--but during the course of exploring [script.aculo.us][s], [Prototype][p], and [Behaviour,js][b] I came up with something that I think has potential.

It's likely to only work on Firefox and Safari, but check it out and drag the boxes around:

View the source, steal anything worth theft, make fun of what's bad.  Oh yeah, and don't mind the ugly background images too much: They were just some random textures I picked out of The Gimp in order to see just how well the transparency on distorted PNGs worked.
