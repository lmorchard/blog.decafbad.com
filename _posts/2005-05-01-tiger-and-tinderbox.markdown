<blockquote>Obviously, it would be difficult to find a stronger [Tinderbox][tb] advocate than I am, and it's the tool I reach for first and most often for my information management needs. But the OS itself is offering more and better tools to help with these sorts of tasks all the time, and it would be great if there was closer cooperation between the application and the OS.</blockquote>

Could [Tinderbox][tb] become an Ã¼ber-interface for Spotlight?  With all the indexed metadata available to on files in Tiger, it makes me wonder how feasible it would be to explode [Tinderbox][tb]:  

Make it a relationship manager and visualizer for files on disk, based on their metadata, rather than maintaining its own private single-file database of notes and their attributes.  Plain old notes could be turned into RTF and text files, and all sorts of other media types could be included.  Links could be represented in metadata, and parent-child relationships come for free as folder/file.  

[Tinderbox][tb] is immensely powerful for its graphical views and templated export capabilities, as well as its amazing agent capabilities.  I've completely succumbed to its ways for capturing and organizing ideas, having completely abandoned outliners and personal wikis over the past year or two.  But, having all this stuff locked in its silo offends my sensibilities, so I've resisted dipping too deep into all of its advanced capabilities.

To be fair, [Tinderbox][tb] bends over backwards to ensure your data is accessible, by saving files as XML for which there are even [XSL-based manipulation tools available][tbxsl].  But, I'd love to be able to use some shell tools and file-based scripts to rummage through my knowledge base, which is just a little to awkward with [Tinderbox][tb] at the moment.

But, just imagine if every [Tinderbox][tb] note was just another file on disk.  There're probably a large number of reasons why this is an unworkable idea, but...
