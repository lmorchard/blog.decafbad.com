<p>Mark Pilgrim <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/04/21.html#autolinkbacks_vs_instant_outlining">writes</a>: <i>IO is more controlled [than linkbacks] -- you have to subscribe to other people's feeds to read their responses -- and is therefore better suited for intentional collaboration. Auto-linkbacks are more about exploration and <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/stories/2002/03/13/manufacturedSerendipity.html">manufacturing serendipity</a>. Must explore this further.</i></p>
<p>This is why I went bananas with the referral links everywhere.  <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0101679/stories/2002/03/13/manufacturedSerendipity.html">Manufactured serendipity</a>.  The referrals do something that a weblog's comment feature just doesn't do.  </p>
<p>Dave &amp; the Userland crew <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/02/23#morningCoffeeNotes">often assert</a> that weblogs are better than discussion groups, for various good reasons.  Radio <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand">UserLand</a> shipped without a comment feature (although it has one now), which I assumed was because the <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand">UserLand</a> opinion was that the convention to comment &amp; respond to someone's weblog was to do it in your own weblog.</p>
<p>The big problem I see, though, is that you're in your own bubble.  If you have something to say about something I wrote, and you're not already in my <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> subscriptions, I'll never read you.  If I don't know you already, chances are that I may not come to be introduced to you.  The same goes for Instant Outlining.  While I appreciate the intentional nature of this tech, and its strengths in avoiding spam, I want to meet you half way.  I want to be surprised and have my ears get warm and turn red when you say something about me.</p>
<p>Referral-driven linkbacks on all pages on my site do this.  If you post to your weblog and include a link to me, then I hear about it the first time someone traverses that link.  This, to me, is even better than the comment feature.  And, as Mark Pilgrim observes, this is better that a single referers page because these linkbacks appear <i>in context</i>.  The conversation is built up from links <i>in place</i> and <i>on topic</i> and <i>where the action is</i>.  To me, this is <a href="http://www.thetwowayweb.com/">the two-way web</a> really in action</p>
