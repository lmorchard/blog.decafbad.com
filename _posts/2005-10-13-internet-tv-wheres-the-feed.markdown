Man, does [This Spartan Life][tsl] ever need--

  1. An RSS feed with video enclosures.
  2. A web site that's not all-Flash.

Because without #1, I could at least scrape #2 to build #1, so as to dump new episodes into my viewing queue automatically.  Manual discovery and download of online video are *so* last centuryâ€”especially with the advent of the video-playing iPod.

P.S.: I'd like video enclosure feeds for [Pure Pwnage][pp], [DigitalLifeTV][dlt], and [The Scene][ts] as well.  I may get motivated to scrape feeds for these, if I keep up with each of these.

[pp]: http://www.purepwnage.com/episodes.html
