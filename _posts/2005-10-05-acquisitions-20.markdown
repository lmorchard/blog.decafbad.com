    Congratulations, Brent!
  
  * [Upcoming.org acquired by Yahoo!][up]  
  
    Congratulations, Andy, [Gordon][g], and [Leonard][l]!

I'm not quite sure what to think about all of this yet, but it makes me wish I'd gotten one of my bright ideas launched.  :)    But, of course, it takes more than just an idea.  It takes execution, timing, and hard work to get to where these guys are today.
