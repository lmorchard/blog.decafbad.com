<p>Have I mentioned lately that I &hearts; <a href="http://www.beanshell.org" target="_top">BeanShell</a> for Java?</p>
<p>I haven't said much about it lately, but I'm still working on my <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PersonalWebProxy">PersonalWebProxy</a> - only this time I'm playing with <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/Java">Java</a> and all the goodies I was wishing for while in <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/Python">Python</a>.  I've got <a href="http://www.hpl.hp.com/semweb/jena.htm" target="_top">Jena</a> and <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/lucene/" target="_top">Lucene</a> and <a href="http://hsqldb.sourceforge.net/" target="_top">HSQL</a> and <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/bsf/index.html" target="_top">BSF</a> and <a href="http://www.part.net/quartz.html" target="_top">Quartz</a> and <a href="http://muffin.doit.org" target="_top">Muffin</a> and...  well, a lot of stuff that feels pretty nice to me.</p>
<p>But, with respect to <a href="http://www.beanshell.org" target="_top">BeanShell</a> in particular, I've got a lot of the nifty live hackability that I had with the things I was playing with in Python.  With no more than 5 lines of code, I've tossed a live interactive shell into my running proxy, into which I can telnet or access via Java console in a browser.  With this, I can get into the machinery before I take the time composing a UI, inserting/removing plugins at will, tossing together new proxy filters on the fly, composing RDQL queries adhoc, tweaking Lucene searches.</p>
<p>Fun stuff, and so easy.  But, sorry, no further code from me yet.  It's very ugly, and barely works, but it's just a sketchpad at the moment.  I hope to have a little something before the end of the month to pass around, should anyone still be interested.</p>
