<p>Well, it doesn't look like I'm getting the new Java-based <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PersonalWebProxy">PersonalWebProxy</a> code released last week or soon this week, but if you'd like <strong>something</strong> to poke fun at, try this...</p>
<p><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BookmarkBlogger">BookmarkBlogger</a> - a quick hack for Safari users to generate blog entries from bookmark folders.</p>
<p>Hope it's useful, bet it's ugly, but it was fun in the making.</p>
