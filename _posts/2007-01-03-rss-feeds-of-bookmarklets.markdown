Hmm, a quick idea:  Has anyone yet tried making an RSS feed of bookmarklets?  I'd use it by dragging it to the Firefox bookmark toolbar to get a drop-down menu of usable bookmarklets, dynamically generated by an online app.  In particular, say I had an outline in XoxoOutliner, and I wanted to treat the first level of items each as a loosely categorized inbox for ideas.  The RSS feed would offer bookmarklets to append a new idea via quick pop-up to each of the top-level branches.
