You know, I just realized that I haven't stepped foot in a public library since I graduated college.  

You know what else I realized?  Our local library has [a great card catalog online][ro], in which I've found everything I tried looking for.  It even seems to have a queue / wishlist feature!  Don't I feel behind the times?  (Though, on the downside, they don't have a copy of *my* book.  Damn, so much for egosurfing in the stacks.)

Now, if only they shipped books around like Netflix.  But, I suppose it wouldn't kill me to talk to a few librarians.  :)
