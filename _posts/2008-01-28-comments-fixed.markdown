Oh, hey.  Nothing like putting out a request for comments and then learning that my comments are broken, and have been since I upgraded to WordPress from SVN.

Not that it's the fault of WordPress - I renamed my comment form on the filesystem and in my theme to obscure it from spambots, but then blew away the renamed PHP file with the SVN upgrade.  Blah.
