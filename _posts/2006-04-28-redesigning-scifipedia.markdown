title: Monkeying with Scifipedia

 <p>The <a href="http://www.scifi.com">SciFi Channel</a> webmasters have launched <a href="http://scifipedia.scifi.com/index.php/Main_Page">Scifipedia</a>, based on <a href="http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a>.  Unfortunately, in my opinion, they've destroyed much of the usability offered by the out-of-box template.  Just try finding the "Recent Changes" page.</p>
 <p>So, I was annoyed enough to crack open a text editor and give it the Greasemonkey treatment:</p>
     <ul>
     <li>
     <span><a href="http://decafbad.com/2006/04/scifipediatweaks.user.js">scifipediatweaks.user.js</a></span>
     </li>
     </ul>
 <p>I mean, I can understand wanting to brand things - and this is a free site after all - but try not to muck with the essentials.</p>
