You know, not that I've been at it for long, but I've had an long-running observation about PHP:

As a language and an API, [PHP kinda stinks][ps].  It's got more crud than I left behind in Perl, but without all the meta-magic that made it worth it.  And, I get a little nervous tic when I think about it in relation to Python and Ruby.

On the other hand, it's ubiquitous and cheapâ€”and because it's in the hands of people with all levels of skill, most popular PHP apps have by necessity managed a high standard of easy install and simplicity.  The languages with more meta-magic tend to attract eggheads (myself included) who can forget about keeping things simple.

And, did I mention PHP is ubiquitous?
