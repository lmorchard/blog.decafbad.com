Oh, and I've been happily doing quite a bit more work lately using [MochiKit][mk].  It just occurred to me this morning that I get a similar feeling from the added capabilities in JavaScript as I did back when I was around 12 or so and I first discovered [Simons' Basic for my C64][sb].

*Ooh, you mean I get an `else` now?  And procedures?  And error trapping?  And a calcluated `GOTO`?  And basic graphics, sound, and I/O commands?  And sprites designed with ASCII art?  Holy crap, this is fun!*
