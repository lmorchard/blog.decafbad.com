The [Ancestor][anc] podcast, like its predecessor [EarthCore][ec], is a fairly formulaic sci-fi slasher tale.  But, it sure as hell beats anything on the [SciFi Channel's Saturday][sci] nights.  And, as I've started to get sucked into [NBC's Surface][sur], I keep finding myself comparing it to [Scott Sigler][ss]'s work.  So far, he's better by a hair in my opinionâ€”but that might as well be better by a mile, since NBC's the one with all the money and presumed talent at their disposal.
