<blockquote cite="http://digg.com/apple/MyDreamApp_3_Winners_Announced">After five grueling rounds, the MDA winners have been announced. Let the development begin!</blockquote><div class="quotesource">Source: <a href="http://digg.com/apple/MyDreamApp_3_Winners_Announced">digg - MyDreamApp, 3 Winners Announced!</a></div>

Spoiler alert - the winners are [Cookbook][cb], [Portal][po], and [Atmosphere][at].  Pretty disappointing, since my faves were [Hijack][hi], [Whistler][wi], and [Desktop Wars][dw].  Of course, I didn't do anything other than vote and occasionally forum-lurk.

Which, matter of fact, is why [Hijack][hi] was my top favorite of all.  I've gotten a lot of read-only coverage of the web from my news aggregator, but I've never ever been able to get into web-distributed forum groups.  Some have RSS feeds, but most don't and I never remember to revisit them.  I love the power of the web, and I love distributed apps - but sometimes I miss Usenet.

Seems like there's a need for Atom-ized comments - that is, a data format for forum aggregators to read and an API for reply submission with spam resistance.  Hijack featured forum HTML scraping as a proposed feature - but what if you could get adoption for some simple plugins for [Wordpress][wp], [phpBB][pbb], [Vanilla][va], etal?  [co.mments][co] seemed promising, but I've just not gotten into it much.  I need to do some poking around to see who is already working on this.
