I think there's something I'm not getting about <a href="http://cocomment.com">coComment</a>.  I've gotten it working via a Greasemonkey script, so I see my comments starting to get tracked.  But, I'm not seeing others' comments.  Well, except for other coComment users, that is.  Is that the deal?  Everyone needs to opt in?
