So, there's one reason for me not to find much enthusiasm for doing a whole lot more with [XoxoOutliner][] lately.  Because, um, you know that bit he says about supporting undo up there?  That sounds oddly familiar.  

Oh yeah.  That's right.  [I implemented undo in XoxoOutliner][undo] back in November - and not very well, at that.  And, though I've got thoughts on how to implement it better - command pattern and all that - the fact remains that there are other apps that do most of what I've been playing with for this thing.

It's been some cool recreational programming, but I do have to admit this:  

I started [XoxoOutliner][] as a sort of [yak shaving][yak] effort to provide me with a more nifty tool for idea management and writing - while at the same time giving me an excuse to not yet actually get down to the work of writing.

Maybe I should just shell out for [a Tinderbox upgrade][tinderbox] and get down to writing again.  If I put any more work into [XoxoOutliner][], I should do it while being fully clear about why I'm doing it.
