<p>Okay, so <a href="http://www.nsi.com">NetSol</a>'s interface for me to change the DNS server responsible for decafbad.com has been coming up with an error page for me, <i>for 3 days now</i>.  I just donated to <a href="http://www.dyndns.org">DynDns.org</a> so I could get some dynamic DNS love going on with some decafbad.com subdomains, but no dice on switching the domain to point at their servers when my registrar's <b>site is broken</b>.</p>
<p>So, I'm going to <a href="http://www.verisignoff.org/">VerisignOff</a>.  I hopped over to <a href="http://www.Pairnic.com/">PairNIC</a> and initiated a transfer.  Let's see how much hassle <i>this</i> brings me.  :)</p>
