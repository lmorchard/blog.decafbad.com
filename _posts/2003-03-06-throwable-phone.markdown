Okay, I don't think I made this up:  I was reading Wired Magazine a
few months ago, and I saw a phone featured in the Fetish section
that was designed like a Koosh<sup>TM</sup> ball or a sea-urchin.
The idea is that it would be used in a teleconference, thrown back
and forth across the room from speaker to speaker.


We need this at my work.


Has anyone else seen this thing, remember what it was called, or
where they're selling it?  I can't seem to find it again in any of
the Wired issues I can find in my apartment and office.
