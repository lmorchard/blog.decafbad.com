I've just started experimenting with integrating
<a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/code/autoping.py" target="_top">Sam Ruby's autoping.py</a> with my blogging
rig here, and discovered that I really had rushed things a bit and didn't
understand what the thing was doing.  I think my caffeine intake for today is
way below baseline, so if yours happens to be one of the sites I mistakenly
vandalized or spammed with broken or erroneous trackbacks, I apologize profusely!
<br /><br />
<b><i>Update:</i></b>  Speaking of Trackback, I just duct taped an initial implementation on
the receiving end with a revision to my <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BlosxomDbcomments">BlosxomDbcomments</a> plugin.  It needs some testing,
so if you see this, and don't mind, pummel this entry with trackbacks!  Next, I'm
considering integrating referrers, thus bringing this new blogging rig up to
where I was <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/old/oooaab.html" target="_top">a little over a year ago</a>.
