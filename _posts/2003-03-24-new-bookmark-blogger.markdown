Playing with a few other little widgets here and there, I thought I'd 
fire off a new revision to the <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BookmarkBlogger">BookmarkBlogger</a> for Safari I've been using
off and on.  This one's a big more OS-X-ish, and uses a properties file
for configuration instead of completely confusing command line options.
<br /><br />
<a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShareAndEnjoy">ShareAndEnjoy</a>!  
<br /><br />
Also working on a lil DOM4J-, JTidy-, and <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/BeanShell?topicparent=Main.FilterData"><b>?</b></a><font color="#0000FF">BeanShell</font></span>-based scraper
for producing <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> from arbitrary web sites.  Yeah, it's been done before,
but not by me and not quite like this.  And eventually I think I want to 
try turning both this and the <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/BookmarkBlogger">BookmarkBlogger</a> into dual-purpose standalone
and <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AgentFrank">AgentFrank</a> plugin packages.
