This gave me an idea for a scifi story:  One day, you wake up and find that nothing seems to work right.  All the affordances you've been used to from everyday things have flip flopped, and all the little things no longer make sense.  Pretty dumb / silly, but might make for a good Twilight-Zone-style story.
