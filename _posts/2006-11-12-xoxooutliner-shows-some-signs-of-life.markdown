Remember when I [started writing about][st] [XoxoOutliner][xo] around 8 months ago?  Yeah, lots has happened with life in general between then and now - but lately I've been [working on code][wo] for it again.  As you might see from [my Trac timeline][time], I've got lots of new code checked in.  And I mean [lots][lots].

If I can keep up this bout of [serial enthusiasm][se] for the project, you'll be hearing lots more about it soon.

For now, check out the new static [README.html][re] and the [live demo][demo].  It's extremely bugful, but it might do interesting things for Firefox and Safari users.
