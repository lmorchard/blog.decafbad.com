I would not like to be planning the next masive EVE Onine scam, or the one after it, or the one after that. For now the comforting strains of "it's just a game" are paying, but some day, some day soon, the weasel will pop.</blockquote><div class="quotesource">Source: <a href="http://research.yale.edu/lawmeme/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=1768">LawMeme - When Virtual Banks Fail</a></div>

If the day comes when in-game offences are punishable by out-of-game laws, I quit the internet.  Or, at least the MMORPG side of it - not that I've got that much an investment in it anyway.  

I mean, sure, some people are making significant real money from play money.  There's value in time spent and time saved running the treadmills.  But no one should be delusioned to think that there's anything other than a service purchase involved, and the laws of the game world are part of the purchase.  If the game world allows a scam, then you bought the fun of an in-game scam along with your rupees or ISK or gold or whatever.  Ignorance of that fact is ignorance, but it ain't an excuse.

Someone has to have thought of this:  What about forming governments, laws, police, and courts inside EVE?  Get scammed once too many times?  Don't escape to the meta level and cry for mommy in the outside world.  Organize and fend for yourselves.  Does the game specifically make this sort of thing impossible?  If so, then the game's broken - stop playing it.
