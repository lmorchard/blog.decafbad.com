Errr... How does that follow?  Just because a Happy Meal comes bundled with LEGO Bricks doesn't mean McDonalds is challenging the housing construction industry.  

And, since when was OpenOffice based on Java?  Last I heard, [WordPerfect for Java](http://java.sun.com/nav/used/corel.html) was doomed back in 1997.  I thought [NeoOfficeJ](http://www.neooffice.org/) was based in Java, but not OpenOffice.
