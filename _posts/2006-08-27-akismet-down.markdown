<blockquote cite="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/08/26/is-akismet-down/">I’ve grown so used to the awesome spam blocker that Wordpress.com includes for free (it comes from Akismet, which is owned by Automattic, the same folks who do Wordpress).  But tonight a TON of spam got through. So, I wonder if Akismet is down or if something got horked?</blockquote><div class="quotesource">Source: <a href="http://scobleizer.wordpress.com/2006/08/26/is-akismet-down/">Is Akismet down? « Scobleizer - Tech Geek Blogger</a></div>

I guess I've just been taking Akismet for granted, since I've only seen comment spam in the dozen-per-day range.  Now I'm up to dozen-per-minute, some days.  I've just tossed in a few bandaid solutions, so we'll see what happens.  Things like this really make me wish I had magic powers to go find the spammers and apply [Chinese water torture](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_water_torture) using bits of processed meat.
