This is why I always try to have a [Debian netinst CD][ni] within arm's reach.  Given a working high-speed internet connection, I can go from a random PC, *tabula rasa*, to a fully functioning and useful server or workstation in under 20 mostly unattended minutes.  And as a server, that little thing can jump right into handling files, email, authentication, and a whole pile of other office-related necessities.

Given about 10 more minutes, I can have a Subversion repository, Trac install, and a full suite of collaboration tools available.  And then...?  It all just keeps working, mostly.  And for the most part, an `apt-get upgrade` from time to time keeps things up to date.

I've never, ever had this experience with Microsoft technology.  On the other hand, I suspect that I should give Ubuntu a look or two, from what I've been hearing.
