In case anyone's interested, I've been hacking like mad on my toy proxy since New Years'.  Check out <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PersonalWebProxy">PersonalWebProxy</a> for current downloads.  It's got primitive forms of proxy filters, browser-based UI, <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF">RDF</a>-based metadata management, logging, config, plugins, and some other goodies.  So far, the major plugins include:
<br /><br />
<ul>
<li> a noisy logger;
</li>
<li> a content archiver that captures and saves all response headers and content in a directory structure loosely based on the requested URL;
</li>
<li> an initial metadata harvester that fills up the <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RDF">RDF</a> database with triples based on headers and details encountered during browsing
</li>
</ul>
<br /><br />
It works, and does stuff, but I'm sure it demonstrates a complete lack of understanding of large portions of the <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/Twisted">Twisted</a> framework, <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/Python">Python</a> itself, and likely causes forest fires.  So, I hope many people will download it, snicker at it, and maybe set me straight on a few things and contribute a few patches and plugins.
