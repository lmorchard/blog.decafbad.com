Although I have [my grousing about PHP in general][gphp], I have to say that it makes much better template language as-is before pulling something like [Smarty][smarty] into the mix.  

At this point, I consider [Smarty][] to be evil—though I'm willing to admit that I haven't grokked it fully yet.  And this is coming from [a templating addict][tmpl] who has been at times in love with [Template Toolkit][tt] in Perl,  [Velocity][] in Java, and [Cheetah][] and [Woven][] and [ZPT/TAL][zpt] in Python.  

[WordPress][] seems to have put native-PHP-as-templating to good use, so I've already got a favorite for comparison.  But the use of [Smarty][] in [reBlog][] rubs me the wrong way.  Of course, [reBlog][] has a lot of highly-abstracted MVC architecture going on.  And this, itself, is something I haven't much in my PHP explorations thus far.  (In fact, I almost hate to see PHP chopped up in this J2EE-esque fashion, but that's another story.  Oh, and [reBlog][] rocks, by the way.)

But either way, [Smarty][] makes this right-handed hacker feel like he's writing with his left.  It seems to have a lot of weird conventions and terminology for which neither knowledge of PHP nor knowledge of other templating systems in general seem much help.  It could just be a learning curve, but to me it seems like an odd *sideways* curve at the moment.  

In fact, you know what?  [Smarty][] reminds me a lot of [DTML in Zope][dtml].  I hate [DTML][]—it, also, is most firmly on my evil list.

Yuck.  Again, it could be just that I haven't known [Smarty][] long enough to like it... but yuck.
