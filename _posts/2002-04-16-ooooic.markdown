<p>Bill Seitz' thoughtspace/wiki <a href="http://webseitz.fluxent.com/wiki/LesOrchard">says about me</a>: <i>Probably the only person using <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RadioUserland">RadioUserland</a>, TWiki, and <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/LiveJournal">LiveJournal</a>? all at the same time.</i></p>
<p>Hmm... really?  Weird.  I've just been kinda sprawling out across as many technologies as I can, because it's fun to play.  Hell, I have 7 species of wiki installed on my laptop (though not all in regular use of course).</p>
<p>Wheee!</p>
