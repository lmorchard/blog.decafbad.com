<p>Still working on getting all the bits of this site working again on the new host.  One thing in particular that's broken are my beloved referer scripts.</p>
<p>But, I'm working on replacements in <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/PHP">PHP</a>.  Noticed that my linkback scripts are <a href="http://iawiki.net/ReferrerLinking">linked to and described</a> on IAwiki.  Also notice some decent wishlist ideas for linkback improvements-- such as first/last referral date and link karma.  And of course there are the improvements I've been meaning to make-- such as <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000142.phtml#000142">metadata harvesting from referrer pages</a> and some improvements on filtering out some bogus/unwanted links (ie. Radio <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/UserLand">UserLand</a> aggregator links).  Might also be nice to allow someone to submit URL patterns they'd like excluded-- that is, if you link to me and don't want me to publish the linkback, you can submit a URL pattern for your site.</p>
<p>Have also been thinking of throwing it together as an open service, like <a href="http://www.yaywastaken.com/referer/default.htm">yaywastaken.com's Link Feedback</a> and <a href="http://www.downes.ca/referrers.htm">Stephen Downes' referral</a> <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/JavaScript?topicparent=Main.FilterData"><b>?</b></a><font color="#0000FF">JavaScript</font></span>-includes.  I can offer the service, and the code.  The only drawback is, well, what might it cost me to offer others a free lunch if the service actually happens to be good. :)</p>
<p>Need to keep thinking about colocation.</p>
