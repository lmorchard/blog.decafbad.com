So, now that I've had [a brief bit][bb] of [serial enthusiasm](http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast) in discovering this whole [microID][] / [claimID][] thing, all it's ended up with in practical terms is [a list of links in my sidebar](http://decafbad.com/blog/#claimid).  So, with that and fully understanding that it's early days yet for [claimID][], I have to ask myself:  What does this do that I couldn't have done with a tagged set of [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/deusx) bookmarks?  Of course, bookmarks on [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/deusx) don't enjoy any sort of [microID][] verification, but that could change - either through features implemented there directly or through a sidecar service.  My [original gripe](http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/08/17/dont-ask-me-who-i-am) was about both machines *and* people finding out about me from a central source.  So far [claimID][] seems to be good for just people finding out about me.

By the way, this is not criticism or a put-down of [claimID][] - this is me thinking out loud and puzzling it out.

*Update:*  Although, I certainly understand the utility of [microID][] in replacing [blog posts like this one](http://vielmetti.typepad.com/superpatron/2006/08/for_technorati.html).
