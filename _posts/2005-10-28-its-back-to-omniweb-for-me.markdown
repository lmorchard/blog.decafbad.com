So, after a good solid several months' run with Firefox, the constant CPU drain finally got to me and I've gone back to [OmniWeb][].  

Firefox was regularly tops in the usage list, and usually sits on about 33% of my CPU and a solid majority of my 1GB of RAMâ€”which makes my already-slow 867Mhz machine feel like 300Mhz.  That, and I haven't had much time to play with GreaseMonkey for awhile, [which was my main reason for switching back to Firefox][switch].  So, it's back to [OmniWeb][] for me.  And man, already this PowerBook feels like it's been greased and waxed.

(*Yes, I need a new machine.  But that ain't happening for awhile yet, and for very good reasons.*)
