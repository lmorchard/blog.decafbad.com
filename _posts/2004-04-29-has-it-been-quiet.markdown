I know I've been Rip-van-Winkeling it in the blogosphere, but has it been getting quieter?  At least in the tech circles?  Going back through some of my archives, I see [raging RSS wars][rss_wars], [REST vs XML-RPC][rest_vs_xmlrpc] arguments, and a slew of little [Lazyweb mini-innovations][lazyweb] on a daily basis.  Hell, even the next long-anticipated release of MovableType is [reported to be meatless][mt_beef].  Also, since I've started actually paying attention to some statistics in [my aggregator][dbagg2], I've noticed a large swath of my 2-3 year old subscriptions have been long silent.  

Seems like it's been a long time since something with the buzz of [Trackback][trackback_buzz] or [Radio UserLand tweaks][radio_tweaks] or [Instant outlining][io] or [RSS autodetection][rss_autodetection] poked its head up.  Maybe it's just blog tech reaching a plateau of relative maturity, or maybe everyone's just getting bored with this stuff.  Personally, one of the main reasons I switched back to MovableType was because of all the long-solved problems and plugins written for me.  I'm mostly tapped out with tinkering with blog software itself.  Granted, I have more things I want to do with this site (and want to write about them), but I want to get down to actual writing and tinkering and writing about tinkering with things other than this blog.

Of course, over the last year or two, I have stopped monitoring a handful of feeds that tended to be at the center of various teacup tempests, so maybe I've just moved myself far enough from the fray that things just sound quiet.  I'm sure there are still the old wars still raging that I've just managed to quarantine from my scans.  Eh, if so, that's not a bad thing.

So now that I'm ostensively back...  what am I missing?
