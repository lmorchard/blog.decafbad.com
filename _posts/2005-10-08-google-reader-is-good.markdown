For what it's worth, I still feel like I've been unfair to the guys at Google over Reader.  

I know how much work must've gone into that thing, because I know how something like that could've been built.  I really think it's just because it's not the right kind of app for me, and I'd like to see someone make that app.  And, I'm also a bit burnt out on the whole AJAX Madness buzz.

Thing is, Reader is *so* good at being what it is.  I'm just critical because it's good at being what I don't want.
