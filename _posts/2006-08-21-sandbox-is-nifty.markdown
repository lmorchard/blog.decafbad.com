I'm really digging the [Sandbox][] theme for WordPress so far.  I've not really done much yet - but between [Sandbox][] and the new [WordPress Widgets][], all my customizations for this blog have been done in CSS and drag-n-drop in the widget management screen.  [Sandbox][] has an enormously rich set of classes dropped into every major element of the page, even down to date/time information on posts and category-based classes.  I could even drop in some seasonal themes to styles posts for holidays and whatnot.  Pumpkins for October, and presents for December!

I *did* need to add one line of PHP to a [Sandbox][] template, and that was a CSS include to my own tack-on CSS full of tweaks to the Spartan skin.  If anything, that's my only feature request so far:  Allow skin selection, and then allow the user to specify an additional stylesheet to further tailor that skin.  The less I need to edit in files installed from third parties, the less I need to maintain when versions get updated.

I'm also running into a few minor CSS oddities when I view my tweaks in MSIE on Windows.  This annoys me, but I only half care to fix them.
