Heard an excellent [interview with Dr. Peter Whybrow on Tech Nation][tn] this week, podcast by [ITConversations][itc].  The idea of America as a nation of restless manic wanderers who've self-selected for genes influencing such behavior just fascinates me.  

  One of the zingers that hit me, paraphrased, was that while it's true a lot of people came here to escape religious persecution--the key thing is that the people who came here *left there*, which leaves the rest of the people under the same conditions who *stayed behind*.  
  
  Depending upon your opinion of the influence genetics have on personality, this sort of decision--to leave everything or stay put--just has to have been a powerful filter.  If neophilia is carried at all by heredity, it has to have had a powerful influence on the development of people here.
  
  I think I might just have to read [American Mania][am]--seems like it would tie in a lot with what I've been thinking about lately, with regard to this country, my life, ambition, neophilia, and satiation.
