I've just received a [Passcard 3][pc3] in the mail.  Nintendo DS homebrew, here I come!  I'm particularly excited about [NitroTracker][nt] and [ScummVM][svm].  Though I've only got a [GBA Movie Player][gbamp] and a 128MB CF flash card from a camera, that seems enough to run most of this stuff so far.  Unfortunately, it just sticks out from the Nintendo DS Lite by an inch or so - almost half the depth of the handheld itself!  I think one of my next purchases may be a more compact and capable [SuperCard MicroSD][sc], which fits flush in the Nintendo DS Lite and accepts MicroSD expansion cards.
