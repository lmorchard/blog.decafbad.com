<p>When I see links in my referrers <a href="http://www.joueb.com/niutopia/news/155.shtml">like this from Niutopia</a>, it makes me wish I had <a href="http://www.scifi.com/farscape/notes/translator.html">translator microbes</a> instead of <a href="http://babelfish.altavista.com/urltrurl?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.joueb.com%2Fniutopia%2Fnews%2F155.shtml&amp;lp=fr_en&amp;tt=url">the Babelfish</a>.  But, at least I have the Fish, and for free!  (Thanks <span style='background : #FFFFCE;'><a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/edit/Main/AltaVista?topicparent=Main.FilterData"><b>?</b></a><font color="#0000FF">AltaVista</font></span>!)  The translation is sketchy and random at best, but it's decent enough for me to get the gist of things.  Now if only I could respond to things in a foriegn language and not accidentally start a war or insult someone's relations, or at best sound like a moron.  It is nice, though, to be reminded that English is not the only language of the web.</p>
