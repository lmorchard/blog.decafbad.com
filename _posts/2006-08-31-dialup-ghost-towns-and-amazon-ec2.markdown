<blockquote cite="http://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/161">Most BBS enthusiasts know that the last outpost for BBSes has been, for some time now, through telnet on the Internet. There was a time, however, when when dial-up BBSes over analog phone lines were the rule, not the exception.</blockquote><div class="quotesource">Source: <a href="http://www.vintagecomputing.com/index.php/archives/161">VintageComputing.com | Vintage Computing and Gaming Â» Blog Archive Â» The Dial-Up BBS Revisited</a></div>
Reading this article, and having [tinkered with Synchronet][sn], an idea occurs to me:  I'll use [Amazon EC2][ec] to host a running instance of [Synchronet][s] available via telnet - _but only from like 9:00 PM until 5:00 AM_.  I'll save hourly hosting charges and not tie up my parents' phone line all day!  Hmm, I wonder:  Has anyone tried setting up an auto answer modem under VoIP?
