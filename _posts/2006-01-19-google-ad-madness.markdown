Wow.  Can you identify the actual content on [this blog entry][p]?  I count plenty of ads, but it took me a minutes to see the short bit of original content there.  No slight intended to the particular author there, since it's something I'm seeing more and more.  But, man.  Last time I had Google ads on my site, I thought the rules were just one ad block per page.  Yeesh.
