* [Bunnyrabbits, Satan, Cheese and Milk][bscm].  Thank you, [Radio Clash][rc], only [trepanning][tre] will help me now.

* I love it when I revamp a source file at work, and the CVS history reflects my clean-up and simplification efforts after check-in by showing hundreds of lines more deleted than added.

  And it actually does more, thanks to some smarter separation of concerns executed by co-workers.  I've really got a fetish for elegance and simplicity in code and design, whether or not I actually end up achieving it in regular practice.
