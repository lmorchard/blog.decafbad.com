<blockquote cite="http://www.russellbeattie.com/notebook/1008657.html">Being able to listen to audio while in the “natural” places you listen to audio (in the car, while walking/running, on the couch, etc.) is what accelerated audio Podcasts to the phenomenon it is today.  Now that there is a way to view video the same way ... that’s going to accelerate that new type of user generated content as well. I’m positive. It’s a no brainer.</blockquote>

I've been gradually easing into subscribing to vidcast feeds, starting to find some early greats out there like [RocketBoom][rb], [Command-N][cn], and [OpenAlpha][oa].  I've also started hacking together feeds for [great online video shows which lack feeds][shows].  And then, there's the occasional private hack I've done to record shows with a capture card or help catch up on TV shows I find on Usenet.  

To watch all of these things in the living room, I use [Xbox Media Center][xbmc] on my modded Xbox, networked to a file server in the basement.  However, there are probably very few other people on the planet who'd bother setting up a rig like mine.  So the combination of iTunes loading feed-delivered video enclosures onto an iPod equipped with an AV cable and a remote sounds like a genius combination for really jump starting the next phase of the vidcasting rise.
