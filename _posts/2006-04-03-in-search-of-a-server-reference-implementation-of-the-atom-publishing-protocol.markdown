 <p>At some point soon, I'm going to want to start playing with the Atom Publishing Protocol for use with <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/03/25/about-xoxooutliner">XoxoOutliner</a>, among other things.</p>
 <p>Can anyone point me toward a reference implementation of a server end-point against which I can bounce a client?  I'm lazy, and don't feel like combing mailing lists / Google searches yet if someone in my reading audience has the scoop.</p>
