Noticed <a href="http://example.com" target="_top">http://example.com</a> linked to via the <a href="http://rdfig.xmlhack.com/">#rdfig weblog</a>, and had this thought: Thank goodness that <a href="http://www.netsol.com/cgi-bin/whois/whois?STRING=example.com&amp;SearchType=do">someone</a> had thought to register that domain, or else my boss would have more likely than not been viewing porn after clicking on a link it in our last meeting.
