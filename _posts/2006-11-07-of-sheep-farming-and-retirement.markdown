Hmm.  A [comment by Joe Grossberg][jg] leads me to consider that perhaps referring to "[sheep farming][sf]" as my eventual stressed-out programmer out-to-pasture phase is as insulting to [those who herd sheep][who] as [using "Mom" to stand in for "naive user"][mom] is to [actual mothers][actual].  Maybe what I'm really after is to [*become* a sheep][become] - though that's a bit scary.  Or better yet, I'd like to be [one of our own pampered cats][cats].  

Yeah, that's the ticket.
