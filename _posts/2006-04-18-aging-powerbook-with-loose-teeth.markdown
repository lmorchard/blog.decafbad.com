 <p>Ugh.  My poor little PowerBook has a few loose teeth on its keyboard.  Heavy use of various keys - as well as a botched attempt at cleaning awhile back - have left a few of the "scissor" mechanisms a bit injured.  I swapped some of these around to less important keys, but I'm debating ordering new parts.  And that's not to mention the half-dozen or so keys whose paint my fingers are wearing through.  Good thing I remember where A and S are.</p>
 <p>Oh yeah, and my AppleCare ran out a little while ago.  Hope the hard drive doesn't keel over again.</p>
 <p>Also:  I'm considering a new MacBook Pro in the next year or so.  I really want to wait for favorable financial conditions, and the next revision or so of the hardware.  I'd like to take better care of it than I have this 40-month-old (or so CoconutBattery says) 867Mhz G4 PowerBook 12".  We have cats, so one of the nastiest things is that there's a micro-hairball woven under each keyboard scissor.  Does anyone have any experience with those silicone keyboard protectors?  Annoying?  Worth it?  Removal of the cats is not an option.</p>
 <p>I just got a new battery for this thing, since my 45 second dashes between power plugs really annoyed me during LibraryCamp.  Hopefully that wasn't a waste.  Now, if I can just get the aluminum case unwarped, I'll be happier.  This thing survived a car accident and got a bit buckled on one corner, so I can't complain too much about this little trooper.</p>
