 <p>So last night, I started making good on the implied threat contained in <a href="http://blogs.opml.org/decafbad/2006/04/03#When:3:26:56PM">yesterday's idle musings about Amazon S3</a>.  I've started building <a href="http://decafbad.com/trac/wiki/S3Ajax">S3Ajax, an AJAX-based wrapper for Amazon's S3</a>.  Between S3, the OPML Community Server API, and what will hopefully come out of the Atom Publishing Protocol - I think web-based filesystem APIs have the potential to be a Next Big Thing.</p>
 <p>Imagine if Amazon S3 offered filtered RSS feeds of new files uploaded to a bucket.  And, imagine if that RSS feed listed those new files as BitTorrent enclosures, with a few item elements fed from metadata headers (ie. title, description, etc).  Instant podcasting.</p>
 <p>Also, imagine if Amazon connected an XSLT processor to S3 like they do with product searches.  You could turn a bucket listing into an RSS feed with an XSLT uploaded to S3 itself.</p>
