Hmm, <a href="http://www.panic.com/~stevenf/mt/archives/000108.php">stevenf gives Zoe some love</a>.  I want to like <a href="http://guests.evectors.it/zoe/">Zoe</a>, and I think I might try it again.  But ever since I <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000120.phtml#000120">first found</a> and <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/news_archives/000122.phtml#000122">later tried</a> Zoe, I've not had much luck with any release.  I think at one point I had a single email appear, but I'm just not getting the mojo.  I think I sorta figured out what I'm supposed to do, but mostly it just sits there munching CPU quietly.  Hrm.  Not that my setup is exotic - I use Mail.app to access an IMAP server on my iBook.  I see others manage to work it.  Trying again...
<br /><br />
<b>Update:</b> It appears that my setup <i>is</i> exotic enough - I'm foolishly using UW IMAP as a quick &amp; dirty install.  As-is, it points to the root of my home directory for email, and I set the IMAP folder prefix to <code>mail/</code> in Mail.app.  Well apparently, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=1183967&amp;forum_id=9709">Zoe doesn't support this</a> and instead tries spidering my entire home directory via IMAP.  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=1259689&amp;forum_id=9709">It appears</a> that there may be hope in a future release, but not for now.  I suppose I might switch IMAP servers, since UW has always given me the willies.  And, I'm assuming that while I'm using IMAP, Mail.app doesn't have any mbox files for Zoe to auto-import.
