Listened to a few really good podcasts today...

* [I've written about wanting this][before], but today I cobbled together an experimental podcast of the [Dr. Demento Show][demento] for myself using [cron][cron], [brag][brag], and [dirCaster][dircaster] on an old iBook-turned-server at home.  It's password protected (which works in iTunes, by the way), probably short-lived, certainly not condoned by anyone empowered to condone this sort of thing--and no, I'm not sharing.

* By similar means, I've acquired a slew of [X Minus One][xm1] and [Dimension X][dx] episodes as MP3s.  I'm tempted to make a BitTorrent-based podcast from those.  I'm not at all certain about the legality, but I do know that I was thoroughly enjoying an "old time radio" audio stream of these shows all last Winter.

* You know, I never knew that [Bruce Campbell][bc] had been in a remake of [The Love Bug][bug].  It came up in an interview during [Slice of Scifi #15][sos15], where they were grousing about all the recent remakes and he said something to the effect of "That one's so old, even *I've* done a remake of it..."

* So far, [The Seanachai][sean] has been brilliant.  I keep thinking I'd really like to do a podcast like this, producing 5-15 minute weekly fiction segments.  Check out [How to Succeed at Evil][evil]...  It's like side stories from [The Tick][tick].  I love the brain-in-a-jar Dalek-esque villain giving himself continual mild concussions as his grey matter repeatedly bumps up against the glass.  (*boonk*, "ow.")  Don't miss the rest of the archives, either.
