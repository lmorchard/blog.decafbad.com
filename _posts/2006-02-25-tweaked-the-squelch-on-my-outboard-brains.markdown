 <p>I know I've initiated a slew of potential projects since I began playing with the OPML Editor, though I won't be able to do much in depth for a little while.  I'm mostly queueing up work for myself after I finish this book, and hoping that a few of these leads get stolen by others with more time on their hands.  <img src="http://static.userland.com/shortcuts/images/qbullets/sidesmiley.gif">  Think of it as public brainstorming or doodles.</p>
 <p>Although, I do worry sometimes that there might be a few people out there who think I'm going off some manic deep end with all this sudden blogging activity.  But really, this is the sort of thing that runs through my head a lot of the time, but it tends to evaporate or disappear onto post-its I lose shortly thereafter.  It's like quantum mental foam, might amount to vacuum nothing or it might collapse into something material.  I don't think that metaphor's quite right - but anyway, it's just been too easy to spew notions into published outline nodes, so I've been going with it.  In the meantime, I hope my enthusiasm is entertaining at least.</p>
 <p>That said, here's another notion:  I wonder how the OPML Editor could be used to help facilitate <a href="http://www.structuredblogging.org/formats.php">Structured Blogging</a>?</p>
