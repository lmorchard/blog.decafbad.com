<pre>* Orangerobot uses cracked software.  I will respond to the following
commands: !ame &lt;msg&gt;, !amsg &lt;msg&gt;, !quit &lt;msg&gt;,
!open_cd, !switch_my_mouse_buttons

&lt;deusx&gt; Hmm.  If what Orangerobot just emoted is true, that's
funny as hell.

&lt;deusx&gt; !amsg Wang!

&lt;Orangerobot&gt; Wang!

&lt;AnitaR&gt; and what's the purpose?

&lt;deusx&gt; AnitaR: Of the message from Orangerobot?

&lt;AnitaR&gt; yes

&lt;AnitaR&gt; must be part of the joke I'm not getting

&lt;AnitaR&gt; yet

&lt;deusx&gt; AnitaR: Could be a joke, but it appears that this person
is using pirated software that's detected its illegitimacy and is
allowing us to manipulate that user's computer.

&lt;adamhill&gt; or its a social experiment by the person behind OR :)

&lt;deusx&gt; adamhill: Or that. :)  Either way, it's fun

&lt;AnitaR&gt; I'm glad it isn't one of those experiments that tests
how strong a shock we'll give the owner

&lt;Argyle&gt; ?def orangerobot

&lt;deusx&gt; Some googling points to this software:
http://www.klient.com

&lt;deusx&gt; !switch_my_mouse_buttons

&lt;deusx&gt; !ame likes cheddar cheese.

* Orangerobot likes cheddar cheese.

&lt;adamhill&gt; ?learn Orangerobot is either a person using cracked
software or a social experiment by a demented psych student

&lt;jibot&gt; I understand now, Dr. Chandra; orangerobot is either a
person using cracked software or a social experiment by a demented
psych student

&lt;deusx&gt; !open_cd

&lt;deusx&gt; okay, I'm done.
