 <p>After reading <a href="http://www.kottke.org/06/05/indiekarma-micropayments">Kottke's post</a> about <a href="http://www.indiekarma.com/">indieKarma</a>, I've signed up and dropped the code into my blog template in a crass and bald-faced move to monetize my blog.  We'll see what happens - and let me know if the thing becomes too annoying or whatnot.  It seems like an interesting concept.</p>
 <p>Just thinking further about this thing - it would be neat if they could eventually include some further features to exploit the cross-blog placement of that JS include.  Maybe some metrics and reporting in general, maybe some more blog-shiny whizbangs, maybe a small indicator of how many other indieKarma-capable visitors hit the site in the last 5 minutes.</p>
