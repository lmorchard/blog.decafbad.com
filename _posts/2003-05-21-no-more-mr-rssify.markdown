<blockquote cite="http://www.voidstar.com/rssify.php">RSSify is a rather horrible hack that shouldn't be needed any more. Please ask the owner of the site you're reading (...) to change to a system that generates <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> natively such as Blogger Pro or Movable Type. Alternatively consider hosting <a href="http://www.voidstar.com/downloads/rssify.php.txt" target="_top">RSSify</a> yourself rather than using my bandwidth.</blockquote>

Noticed this show up suddenly today as the new item to a surprising number of
feeds to which I subscribe.  I knew <a href="http://www.voidstar.com" target="_top">Julian Bond</a>'s public <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a>ifying service
had gotten used far and wide, but wow.  The bandwidth bills must've been getting
quite annoying, having become a sort of adhoc bit of the
<a href="http://www.rube-goldberg.com/" target="_top">Rube Goldberg</a> blog
infrastructure.  So, as for my own consumption, thanks for the use of your tool Julian, and
all apologies for being a leech!

Well, I'm still working a bit on my own Java-based transmogrifier robot
to scrape disparate sources of info into <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> feeds for me.  I suppose I
should get to work trading my <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a>ify-based subscriptions for my own
DIY-scraped versions.  If I get some time soon, I'll wrap this thing
up and release it.  But first, I hope to get it fully automatedly working with the
iTunes Music Store, <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/blog/tech/itunes_rss.html" target="_top">as I've been tinkering</a>.
