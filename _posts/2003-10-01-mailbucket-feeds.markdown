Just discovered Tom Dyson's
<a href="http://www.mailbucket.org/index.html">Mailbucket.org</a>,
and started playing around with signing up mailing lists
for feeds.  It's simple, send an email to
<a href="mailto:foo@mailbucket.org">foo@mailbucket.org</a>,
then check <a href="http://mailbucket.org/foo.xml">http://mailbucket.org/foo.xml</a>
for an RSS feed.
I was tinkering with something like it last week, using
Postfix, Mail::Audit, and blosxom -- but hey, if someone else
has done it, I'll just go use theirs! :)

A few feeds I've set up:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://mailbucket.org/cocoa-dev.xml">cocoa-dev</a> from Apple</li>
<li><a href="http://mailbucket.org/macosx-dev.xml">macosx-dev</a> from OmniGroup</li>
</ul>
