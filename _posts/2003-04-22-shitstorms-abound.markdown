Wow.  Missed <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/04/18/enough_already.html" target="_top">this from Mark</a> over
the weekend, and then further missed <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/1345.html" target="_top">Sam's link to it</a>
and the subsequent whirling mass of shitstorm that rolled past in its wake.  Well, at least everyone 
just ends up being an asshole in the end, and no nazis or ethnicities 
or monsters were invoked in the process.  And no one co-opted any acronyms, though I think
someone got ketchup on their tie.  Hope it wasn't silk.  And does anyone know if all us assholes
are actually alive or dead in Schroedinger's Trunk?
