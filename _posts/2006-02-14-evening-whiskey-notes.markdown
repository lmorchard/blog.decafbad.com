 <p>One more shot with my hacked up WordPress tool, now with lists:</p>
     <ul>
     <li>
     <span>I think I may have roped <a href="http://blogs.opml.org/vacuum/">Ed Vielmetti</a> into this OPML thing with my enthusiasm of late.  :)</span>
     </li>
     <li>
     <span>So, I checked out and compiled the OPML Editor <a href="http://frontierkernel.sourceforge.net/">from source</a> under Mac OS X during dinner.  It ran and appeared to work fine with a backup of all my stuff.  Beyond that, I don't know what I'm doing - yet.  But, just like when I downloaded and built the first release of Mozilla, this gives me some geeky comfort.  (Only well, unlike Mozilla, this thing didn't crash & burn out of the box.)</span>
     </li>
     <li>
     <span>Hmm, need to tweak the WordPress tool to produce HTML lists instead of tables.  There, <i>done</i>.  I just tweaked <code>wordPressSuite.getPostText</code> to produce nested HTML lists that are more friendly to styling via CSS.  If anyone happens to want my tweak, let me know.</span>
     </li>
     </ul>
