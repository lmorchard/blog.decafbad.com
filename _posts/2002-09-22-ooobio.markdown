After following the <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/836.html">thread on Sam Ruby's blog</a> about <a href="http://scriptingnews.userland.com/backissues/2002/09/20#When:8:39:43AM">Dave's  comment tracking feature request</a>, I figured I'd try <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a>-izing comments on each of my posts.  As things seem to have been going lately, I'd underestimated <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType">MovableType</a>, and it turned out <strong>so</strong> much easier than I'd thought.  :)  I'd had an <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/recent_comments_rss.xml">RSS feed for comments overall</a> on my site, but now I have individual <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> feeds for each post.  (Notice the <img src="http://www.decafbad.com/images/xml.gif"> in the comments section now.)  The <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> feed is also linked in the head as per <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/05/31.html#more_on_rss_autodiscovery">RSS autodiscovery</a> discussions.
<br /><br />
I don't think aggregators are really ready yet for these per-post comment <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> feeds, but the availability of the data gives food for hacking.  Being that they're pretty disposable and of interest for a very short time, aggregators will likely need to implement expiry times for feeds, or watch for a period of inactivity before unsubbing.  Grouing feeds would be nice too, in case I wanted to round up all my points of weblog discussion participation.  I've got a few things of this sort in my <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/AmphetaOutlinesWishList">AmphetaOutlinesWishList</a>, with which I hope to play with further aggregator ideas.
<br /><br />
If you use <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType">MovableType</a> and you're interested in trying this, check out these two templates:  <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/recent_comments_rss.xml.tmpl">recent_comments_rss.xml.tmpl</a>, for blog-wide comments; and <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/archive_entry.rss.tmpl">archive_entry.rss.tmpl</a>, for per-post comments.  The former template is added as an index template in <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/MovableType">MovableType</a>, whereas the latter is an archive template.  Also, the per-post archive template will need to be added to the list of individual archive templates in the <strong>Archiving</strong> section of your blog config.  You'll want to give it a template for the filename, perhaps something like <code><$MTEntryID pad="1"$>.rss</code>.
<br /><br />
At present, I'm publishing in what I think is vaguely <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> 0.92 format.  Whether it complies with the spec, I'm not quite sure because I was lazy.  I plan to revisit this soon to make it at least comply with <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/RSS">RSS</a> 1.0.  <a href="http://www.decafbad.com/twiki/bin/view/Main/ShareAndEnjoy">ShareAndEnjoy</a>.
