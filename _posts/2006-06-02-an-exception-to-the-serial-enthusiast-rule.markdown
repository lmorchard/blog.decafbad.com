 <p>I've got some further posts percolating with regards to <a href="http://decafbad.com/blog/2006/05/26/confessions-of-a-serial-enthusiast">this serial enthusiast notion</a> - but as The Date is fast approaching (7 days!), I'll repost <a href="http://www.annezelenka.com/2006/06/serial-enthusiasms-and-enduring-passions#comment-435">a comment left on Anne Zelenka's blog</a>:</p>
 <p>I&#8217;ve been lucky enough to find someone who&#8217;s not only tolerant of my serial enthusiasms, but apparently enjoys being around me. And, I&#8217;ve found that in her case my enthusiasm has only been constant and growing and shows no sign of wander. Alexandra&#8217;s been a daily source of novelty to me, so I think she&#8217;s one rare case wherein I&#8217;m happy to tie up loose ends and commit to a lifetime of future support.</p>
